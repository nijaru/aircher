# Aircher Project Status

**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025
**Current Version**: Development (pre-alpha)
**Repository**: Public at https://github.com/nijaru/aircher

## üìä Executive Summary

Aircher is an **ACP-compatible agent backend** (not TUI) in Week 1 of 10-week development plan. Focus is research-grade agent intelligence for publication.

**Current Status**: 2 production-quality tools (read_file, analyze_errors), 8 stubs. Building toward ACP integration with Zed/JetBrains.

**Bottom Line**: Research project targeting 10-week timeline for empirical benchmarks vs Claude Code + publication.

## üéØ What Actually Works Today

### ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL (Production-Ready)
- **Semantic Code Search**: Production-ready search across 19+ languages (6,468 vectors)
- **Multi-Provider Auth**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama authentication
- **Enhanced read_file Tool**: ‚ú® NEW - Production-quality with:
  - Tree-sitter syntax highlighting (19+ languages)
  - AST-based context extraction (surrounding functions/classes)
  - Smart truncation for large files
  - File metadata (size, permissions, modified time)
  - Comprehensive tests (430+ lines of real code)
- **analyze_errors Tool**: Real error pattern matching
  - Extracts file locations from error messages
  - Categorizes errors (Borrow, Type, Import, etc.)
  - Provides actionable fixes
  - Confidence scoring (378 lines)

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Week 1)
- **write_file Tool**: Next (Days 2-3)
- **edit_file Tool**: Following (Days 3-4)
- **list_files Tool**: Final Week 1 tool (Days 4-5)

### ‚ùå NOT WORKING / MISSING
- **8 out of 10 tools are stubs** (down from 9)
- **ACP Protocol**: Not implemented (Week 3 target)
- **TUI**: Removed - focusing on ACP agent backend only
- **Code Understanding Tools**: Week 2 target (search_code, analyze_code, etc.)

## üîç Detailed Feature Matrix

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Core Infrastructure** | | |
| Semantic Search | ‚úÖ WORKING | Production-ready, 19+ languages |
| TUI Interface | ‚úÖ WORKING | Complete terminal UI |
| Multi-Provider Auth | ‚úÖ WORKING | 4 providers supported |
| Tool Calling Pipeline | ‚úÖ WORKING | End-to-end execution |
| | | |
| **AI Agent Capabilities** | | |
| Strategy Execution | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Executes without crashing, 1 real tool + 9 stubs |
| Error Analysis | ‚úÖ WORKING | analyze_errors has REAL implementation with patterns |
| Code Analysis | ‚ùå STUB | Other analysis tools still return fake responses |
| Reflection/Planning | ‚ùå STUB | reflect/plan tools return generic responses |
| Code Generation | ‚ùå MISSING | Not implemented |
| | | |
| **Advanced Features** | | |
| Approval Workflows | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | UI exists, integration incomplete |
| Background Tasks | ‚ùå MISSING | Architecture ready, not implemented |
| Session Management | ‚ùå MISSING | Basic conversation only |
| Learning/Memory | ‚ùå MISSING | Infrastructure exists, not functional |

## üöÄ What You Can Actually Test

### Demo-Ready Features
```bash
# 1. Semantic search (actually works)
cargo run
/search "error handling"

# 2. Basic chat with models (works)
cargo run
# Chat with any configured LLM provider

# 3. Strategy execution (runs without crashing, returns fake responses)
cargo run --bin test_react_strategy
cargo run --bin test_strategy_with_mock
```

### What NOT to Demo
- Don't show strategy tools to users expecting real intelligence
- Don't claim the agent can solve actual coding problems
- Don't compare tool outputs to Claude Code (they're just JSON stubs)

## üíØ Honest Competitive Position

**Current**: ~16-20% feature parity with Claude Code (slight improvement!)
- ‚úÖ Has basic infrastructure
- ‚úÖ ONE real tool (analyze_errors) provides actual value
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 9 other strategy tools still stubs
- ‚ùå Missing most intelligent functionality

**Progress Update (Sep 19, 2025)**:
- +1% for first real tool implementation (analyze_errors)
- Real error parsing and actionable fixes now working
- Still need 9+ more real tools for meaningful competitive position

**vs Claude Code**: Missing 80%+ of functionality
**vs Cursor**: Missing 75%+ of functionality
**vs GitHub Copilot**: Missing 85%+ of functionality

## üõ£Ô∏è Realistic Development Timeline

### ‚úÖ ACHIEVED: First Real Tool Working (Sep 19, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Implemented real `analyze_errors` tool with pattern matching
- ‚úÖ Tested with actual Rust compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Validated it provides real value vs stub

### ‚úÖ ACHIEVED: Major Architecture Insight (Sep 19, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Discovered we over-engineered agent reasoning (1685-line MultiTurnReasoningEngine)
- ‚úÖ Research shows models do reasoning internally - agents should focus on execution
- ‚úÖ Built enhanced prompting system with ReAct, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts patterns
- ‚úÖ Validated enhanced prompts work for debug, analysis, multi-step, exploration tasks

### Next 2 Weeks: Simplify Architecture & Build Real Tools
- Replace complex MultiTurnReasoningEngine with enhanced prompting (-1685 lines)
- Implement `reflect` tool with actual analysis (leveraging new insights)
- Build real `brainstorm` for creative solutions
- Test simplified architecture performs as well as complex system

### Next 1-2 Months: Core Tool Set
- Implement 3-5 real tools
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Validate each tool provides user value

### Next 3-6 Months: Meaningful Functionality
- Complete core intelligent tool set
- Add real code analysis capabilities
- Achieve 30-40% competitive parity

### 12+ Months: Competitive Product
- Full feature set comparable to Claude Code
- Production-ready reliability
- Unique competitive advantages

## üö® Critical Limitations (READ FIRST)

1. **Tools Are Stubs**: 9 out of 10 strategy tools return hardcoded responses (only analyze_errors is real)
2. **Over-Engineered Reasoning**: 1685-line MultiTurnReasoningEngine when models do reasoning internally
3. **Architecture Mismatch**: Agent tries to externalize what models already optimize for
4. **Path Forward Clear**: Enhanced prompting system ready to replace complex orchestration

## üéØ For New Contributors

### If You Want to Help with Infrastructure:
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX improvements
- Additional language support for semantic search

### If You Want to Build Real Intelligence:
- Pick a stub tool and implement real functionality
- Focus on user value, not architectural elegance
- Test with real codebases and workflows

### If You Want to Test/Evaluate:
- Test semantic search (actually works)
- Test TUI interface (fully functional)
- **Don't** test strategy intelligence (just stubs)

## üìù How to Update This Document

This document should be the **single source of truth** for project status. When implementing new features:

1. Update feature matrix first
2. Test thoroughly before marking as "WORKING"
3. Be honest about limitations
4. Update competitive position realistically

**Rule**: If a feature is marked "WORKING" here, it should provide real user value, not just execute without crashing.
