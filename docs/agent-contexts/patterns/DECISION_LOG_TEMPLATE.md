# üìä Decision Log Template
*Append-only record of architectural and technical decisions*

## Purpose
Document the rationale behind important choices to:
- **Prevent revisiting** settled decisions
- **Understand context** of past choices
- **Learn from outcomes** of decisions
- **Onboard new contributors** quickly

## Template Structure

## 2025-02-04 | Documentation Strategy for AI Agents

### Context
Need efficient way for AI agents to maintain context between sessions and track work.

### Options Considered
1. **GitHub Issues/Projects**
   - Pros: Standard tool, good for collaboration, API access
   - Cons: Network latency, not in AI context, complexity
   
2. **Database/JSON files**
   - Pros: Structured data, queryable
   - Cons: Overhead to maintain, schema changes, parsing needed

3. **Markdown files in repo**
   - Pros: Instant access, version controlled, human readable
   - Cons: Less structured, manual updates

### Decision
**Chosen: Markdown files with specific structure**

### Rationale
- AI agents need immediate access without API calls
- Version control provides history automatically
- Human readable for debugging and review
- Simple to update and maintain
- Works offline

### Consequences
- Excellent AI agent workflow
- All changes tracked in git
- May need tooling for complex queries later
- Team must follow documentation patterns

### Review Date
After 3 months of usage

## Best Practices

### DO
- ‚úÖ Document while memory is fresh
- ‚úÖ Include all serious options
- ‚úÖ Be honest about trade-offs
- ‚úÖ Set review dates for big decisions
- ‚úÖ Link to relevant research/data

### DON'T
- ‚ùå Document trivial choices
- ‚ùå Skip the "cons" of chosen option
- ‚ùå Forget to note assumptions
- ‚ùå Make it a debate record

## Integration

- Referenced by `SESSION_LOG.md` when decisions are made
- Influences `ACTION_PLAN.md` priorities
- Prevents duplicate discussions
- Provides context for new team members
