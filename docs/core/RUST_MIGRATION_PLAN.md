# Aircher Go-to-Rust Migration Plan

## Migration Overview

This document outlines the complete migration of Aircher from Go to Rust while preserving the existing architecture, functionality, and project goals. The migration will be done in phases to ensure stability and allow for validation at each step.

**Migration Rationale:**
After comprehensive technical analysis, Rust provides definitive advantages for Aircher's core requirements:

**TUI Performance Superiority:**
- `ratatui`: Zero-copy rendering, no GC stuttering during streaming
- Immediate mode UI updates for smooth LLM response streaming
- Superior memory management for long-running terminal sessions
- Compile-time widget validation prevents runtime UI errors

**LLM Integration Technical Advantages:**
- `tokio` + `reqwest`: Superior async HTTP client with better streaming than Go
- `serde`: Compile-time JSON validation vs runtime parsing errors
- Better structured concurrency for multiple concurrent provider calls
- Zero-allocation streaming directly to TUI components

**Long-term Reliability:**
- Memory safety eliminates entire classes of bugs in long-running processes
- Compile-time guarantees for configuration, SQL queries, and API schemas
- Superior error handling with rich context and type safety
- No garbage collection pressure during intensive streaming operations

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks with phased implementation (reduced due to simpler LLM integration)
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium (LLM SDK gap is minimal - mostly REST + JSON)

---

## Technology Stack Mapping

### Core Framework Migration
| Go Component | Rust Equivalent | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `bubbletea` | `ratatui` + `crossterm` | **Zero-copy rendering, no GC stuttering** |
| `lipgloss` | `ratatui::style` + custom styling | **Immediate mode styling, better performance** |
| `sqlx` + SQLite | `sqlx` + SQLite | **Compile-time SQL validation** |
| `zerolog` | `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` | **Structured async-aware logging** |
| `toml` crate | `serde` + `toml` | **Compile-time config validation** |

### LLM Provider Integration
| Provider | Go Implementation | Rust Implementation | Rust Advantage |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| OpenAI | `go-openai` | `async-openai` (948k downloads) | Superior streaming, zero-copy |
| Anthropic | `anthropic-sdk-go` | `anthropic-sdk-rust` + custom | Better async, type safety |
| OpenRouter | Manual HTTP | Same as OpenAI (compatible API) | Unified implementation |
| Gemini | Manual implementation | `reqwest` + `serde` | Compile-time validation |
| Ollama | Manual HTTP client | `reqwest` + `serde` | Better local streaming |

**Key Insight**: LLM providers are just REST APIs. Rust's `reqwest` + `serde` stack is superior to any "official" SDK for HTTP/JSON operations.

### Development Tools
| Go Tools | Rust Equivalents | Integration |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| `golangci-lint` | `clippy` | Built-in linter |
| `gofumpt` | `rustfmt` | Built-in formatter |
| `go test` | `cargo test` | Built-in test runner |
| `go mod` | `cargo` | Built-in dependency management |

## Architecture Preservation Strategy

### Core Architecture Mapping
```rust
// Preserve the same clean architecture patterns
pub mod core {
    pub mod domain;      // Business logic (equivalent to internal/core)
    pub mod providers;   // LLM providers (equivalent to internal/providers)
    pub mod storage;     // Database layer (equivalent to internal/storage)
}

pub mod infrastructure {
    pub mod tui;         // Terminal interface (equivalent to internal/tui)
    pub mod config;      // Configuration (equivalent to internal/config)
    pub mod mcp;         // MCP integration (equivalent to internal/mcp)
}

pub mod application {
    pub mod services;    // Application services
    pub mod handlers;    // Command handlers
}
```

### Interface Design Preservation
```rust
// Maintain the same provider pattern
#[async_trait]
pub trait LLMProvider: Send + Sync + Debug {
    async fn chat(&self, req: ChatRequest) -> Result<ChatResponse, LLMError>;
    async fn chat_stream(&self, req: ChatRequest)
        -> Result<Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = Result<ChatToken, LLMError>> + Send>>, LLMError>;

    fn supports_functions(&self) -> bool;
    fn supports_system_messages(&self) -> bool;
    fn supports_images(&self) -> bool;
    fn supports_thinking(&self) -> bool;
    fn get_token_limit(&self, model: &str) -> u32;
    fn count_tokens(&self, content: &str) -> Result<u32, LLMError>;
    fn calculate_cost(&self, tokens: u32, model: &str) -> Result<f64, LLMError>;
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn models(&self) -> &[String];
}
```

### Database Schema Preservation
```rust
// Maintain the same multi-database architecture
pub struct DatabaseManager {
    conversations: SqlitePool,  // conversations.db
    knowledge: SqlitePool,      // knowledge.db
    file_index: SqlitePool,     // file_index.db
    sessions: SqlitePool,       // sessions.db
}
```

- Create async utilities and helper functions

#### 2. TUI Rendering Performance
**Risk**: Complex terminal rendering could cause performance issues
**Mitigation**:
- Profile rendering performance early and often
- Use `ratatui`'s built-in optimization techniques
- Test on various terminal emulators and sizes
- Implement efficient state diffing

#### 3. LLM API Compatibility
**Risk**: Provider API changes or rate limiting issues
**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive retry logic
- Create robust error handling with user feedback
- Add provider fallback mechanisms
- Monitor API changes and deprecations

#### 4. Database Migration Complexity
**Risk**: Data loss or corruption during schema migration
**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive backup system
- Test migrations with realistic data sets
- Implement rollback mechanisms
- Validate data integrity after migration

### Project Risks and Mitigations

#### 1. Feature Regression
**Risk**: Lost functionality during migration
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain feature parity checklist
- Implement comprehensive integration tests
- Regular comparison testing with Go version
- User acceptance testing at each phase

#### 2. Performance Degradation
**Risk**: Rust version slower than Go version
**Mitigation**:
- Continuous performance benchmarking
- Profile memory usage and allocations
- Optimize hot paths and async operations
- Use Rust-specific performance techniques

#### 3. Timeline Slippage
**Risk**: Migration takes longer than planned
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
- Implement MVP first, then enhance
- Regular progress reviews and adjustments
- Buffer time for unexpected complexity

    fn test_config_loading() {
        let config = Config::load_from_file("test_config.toml").unwrap();
        assert_eq!(config.providers.default, "openai");
    }
}
```
