aircher model set                # Interactive model selection
aircher model set gpt-4          # Set default model directly
aircher model info gpt-4         # Show model details (provider, pricing, capabilities)
```

**TUI Integration Commands:**
```bash
# Main TUI Interface (like Claude Code)
aircher                          # Start TUI with current default service/model
aircher --service openai         # Start TUI with specific service
