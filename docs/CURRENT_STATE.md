# Aircher Current State Analysis

## What Actually Works Today

### ✅ Fully Functional
- **TUI Chat Interface** (`src/ui/mod.rs`)
  - Send messages to LLMs
  - Receive streaming responses
  - Switch providers/models with `/model`
  - Authentication with `/auth`
  - Configuration with `/config`

- **Multi-Provider Support** (`src/providers/`)
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama
  - API key management
  - Model selection and validation

- **Semantic Search** (`src/search/`, `src/intelligence/`)
  - `/search` command works in TUI
  - 19+ language support
  - Vector search with hnswlib-rs
  - Index persistence and caching

### ⚠️ Built but Disconnected

**Agent System** (`src/agent/`)
```rust
// This exists and works:
pub struct AgentController {
    tools: ToolRegistry,
    // ... handles tool execution
}

// But it's never called from TUI!
// No connection in src/ui/mod.rs
```

**Tool Registry** (`src/agent/tools/`)
```rust
// These tools are implemented:
- read_file
- write_file  
- edit_file
- list_files
- run_command
- search_code
- find_definition

// But they can't be triggered from chat!
```

**Permission System** (`src/agent/tools/permission_handler.rs`)
```rust
// Approval flow exists but unused
pub async fn request_permission() -> bool
```

### ❌ Completely Missing

1. **Tool Calling Parser**
   - No code to detect `<tool_use>` in LLM responses
   - No XML/JSON parsing for tool parameters
   - No tool result formatting

2. **Agent-TUI Connection**
   ```rust
   // Missing in src/ui/mod.rs:
   fn handle_tool_request(&mut self, tool_call: ToolCall) {
       // This doesn't exist
   }
   ```

3. **Tool UI Components**
   - No tool status display
   - No approval dialog in TUI
   - No progress indicators

## Code Locations

### Key Files to Modify

1. **src/ui/mod.rs** (TuiManager)
   - Add agent controller field
   - Parse messages for tool calls
   - Handle tool execution flow

2. **src/agent/controller.rs**
   - Currently standalone
   - Needs integration points
   - Add streaming callbacks

3. **src/providers/mod.rs**
   - Add tool calling format
   - Standardize across providers

### Example Integration Point

```rust
// src/ui/mod.rs - This is what's missing:

impl TuiManager {
    async fn handle_assistant_message(&mut self, content: String) {
        // Current code just displays the message
        self.add_message(Message::assistant(content));
        
        // MISSING: Parse for tool calls
        if let Some(tool_call) = parse_tool_call(&content) {
            // Execute through agent
            let result = self.agent.execute_tool(tool_call).await?;
            // Show result
            self.add_message(Message::tool_result(result));
            // Continue conversation...
        }
    }
}
```

## Why This Matters

**Current user experience**:
```
User: "Read the file src/main.rs"
Assistant: "I'll read that file for you. [Describes what it would do but can't actually do it]"
```

**What competitors have**:
```
User: "Read the file src/main.rs"
Assistant: <tool_use>read_file</tool_use>
[Actually reads and shows file contents]
```

## Quick Test Commands

To verify current state:

```bash
# This works (chat):
cargo run --release
> /model  # select provider
> Hello   # get response

# This works (search):
> /search async functions

# This DOESN'T work (tools):
> Read the file Cargo.toml
# Bot will say it'll help but can't actually read the file
```

## The Gap

The irony: We have a sophisticated agent system with tools, permissions, and error handling, but it sits completely disconnected from the user interface. The TUI can chat with LLMs, but the LLMs can't use any tools.

**It's like having a car with an engine and wheels that aren't connected.**

## Next Step

Connect the engine to the wheels:
1. Add `agent_controller: Option<AgentController>` to TuiManager
2. Initialize it when provider is selected
3. Parse assistant messages for tool calls
4. Execute and display results

This is Phase 1 in the roadmap and blocks everything else.
