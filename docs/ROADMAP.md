# Agent Intelligence Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27
**Focus**: Intelligent ACP-compatible agent backend - NO UI development

## üéØ Mission

Build a research-grade intelligent agent backend that works via Agent Client Protocol (ACP) in any compatible frontend (Zed, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, Emacs, VSCode).

**What we're building:**
- ‚úÖ Novel agent intelligence architecture
- ‚úÖ Intent classification and dynamic context management
- ‚úÖ Pattern-aware code generation
- ‚úÖ Empirical validation vs competitors
- ‚úÖ Publication-worthy research contributions

**What we're NOT building:**
- ‚ùå Custom TUI, IDE, or editor
- ‚ùå UI themes, keyboard shortcuts, terminal rendering
- ‚ùå Enterprise features (SSO, audit trails, team collaboration)

## üìä Current Reality (October 2025)

### Major Strategic Pivot: SOTA Architecture Redesign ‚ú®

**Research Findings** (Oct 27, 2025):
- **Factory Droid**: 58.8% Terminal-Bench using specialized agents
- **OpenCode**: Plan/Build separation + LSP integration + Git snapshots
- **Claude Code**: Sub-agents work for research (90% improvement) but terrible for coding (15x waste)
- **Amp**: Multi-model routing for cost optimization

**New Direction**: Hybrid architecture combining best patterns from all tools

### What Actually Works ‚úÖ
- **Week 6 Complete**: ACP protocol with session management, streaming, error handling (+635 lines)
- **Memory Systems**: ALL 3 complete (3,725 lines) - Episodic, Knowledge Graph, Working
- **Semantic Search**: Production-ready (6,468 vectors, 19+ languages, sub-second)
- **Multi-Provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama authentication
- **6 Production Tools**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_files, analyze_errors, analyze_code (2,300+ lines)

### What's Being Redesigned üîÑ
- **Agent Architecture**: Single agent ‚Üí Hybrid (Plan/Build modes + research sub-agents)
- **LSP Integration**: Adding real-time diagnostics feedback (from OpenCode pattern)
- **Git Snapshots**: Safe experimentation with auto-rollback (from OpenCode)
- **Model Routing**: Multi-model selection based on task complexity (from Amp)
- **Specialized Agents**: Explorer, Builder, Debugger, Refactorer configs (from Factory Droid)

### Competitive Position (Updated)
- **30-33% feature parity** with Claude Code (infrastructure complete, capabilities growing)
- **Unique advantages**: Memory systems (nobody has), ACP multi-frontend, intent-driven architecture
- **Research validated**: Patterns from 4 SOTA tools combined
- **Timeline**: Weeks 7-10 implement new architecture + benchmarks

## üö´ Anti-Goals (Explicit Non-Priorities)

### Not Building (UI/Frontend)
- ‚ùå Custom TUI application
- ‚ùå Terminal rendering or themes
- ‚ùå Keyboard shortcut systems
- ‚ùå Custom editor or IDE

**Why**: Zed/JetBrains/Neovim handle this better. We focus on agent intelligence.

### Not Building (Enterprise)
- ‚ùå Team collaboration features
- ‚ùå Enterprise SSO/authentication
- ‚ùå Audit trails and compliance
- ‚ùå Multi-user permissions
- ‚ùå Usage analytics dashboards

**Why**: Individual developer productivity, not enterprise platform.

### Not Building (Scope Creep)
- ‚ùå IDE integrations beyond ACP
- ‚ùå Browser-based UIs
- ‚ùå Mobile applications
- ‚ùå Hosted SaaS offering
- ‚ùå Non-agent features

**Why**: Stay focused on research contributions in agent intelligence.
