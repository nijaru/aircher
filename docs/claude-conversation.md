  Now let me also add the missing log import and test this. But first, let me check if there's an issue with how the autocomplete is
  being called when the user types '/'. The problem might be that the cursor position or input is not what we expect.

  Let me also check if there are any issues with the SLASH_COMMANDS import or structure.

⏺ Let me add the log import and also check if there's an issue with SLASH_COMMANDS:

  Now let me also add some defensive programming to the add_command_suggestions method to handle any potential issues with
  SLASH_COMMANDS access:

  you need me to copy and paste how claude handles user messages vs llm thinking vs llm tool use vs llm output?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about:
  1. Whether we should make changes to our current status bar - they think it's good as is
  2. Round the corners of the text entry box if possible
  3. Whether I need information about how Claude handles different message types (user vs LLM thinking vs tool use vs output)

  Let me first build and test the autocomplete fix to see if the / breaking issue is resolved, then think about the design questions.

  For rounding corners in terminal UI, this is tricky since we're limited to character-based rendering. We could use Unicode box drawing
   characters with rounded corners, but it might not work well across all terminals.

  For the Claude message handling, that could be useful to understand how to better display different types of messages in our
  interface.

  Let me focus on building and testing the autocomplete fix first.

⏺ Let me build and test the autocomplete fix first, then address the UI improvements:
