# Development Sprint Planning

## Current Project Status
- **Phase 4 (Advanced Features)**: 75% complete
- **Testing Framework**: ✅ Complete with dependency injection
- **TUI Integration**: ✅ Complete with Intelligence Engine
- **Core Providers**: ✅ Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter
- **Session Management**: ✅ Complete with persistence and analytics

## Next Sprint Priorities

### 1. SPRINT-007: Ollama Local Provider (RECOMMENDED NEXT)
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: None

**Why Now:**
- ✅ No external API dependencies - can implement and test completely offline
- ✅ Adds valuable local model support (Llama 3.3, Qwen 2.5, etc.)
- ✅ Complements existing API providers with free local alternative
- ✅ Medium effort vs large effort for other high-priority sprints
- ✅ Can be fully tested with existing testing framework

**Implementation Approach:**
```rust
// src/providers/ollama.rs
pub struct OllamaProvider {
    base_url: String,           // Default: http://localhost:11434
    http_client: reqwest::Client,
    available_models: Vec<String>,
}

// Key features:
// - Model discovery via /api/tags endpoint
// - Streaming chat via /api/chat endpoint
// - Health checking via /api/version
// - Free pricing model (PricingModel::Free)
// - Local model management integration
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Async Ollama API client for local communication
- ✅ Streaming responses from local models
- ✅ Provider → Model → Host hierarchy integration
- ✅ Model discovery and health checking
- ✅ Free cost tracking (local models)
- ✅ Error handling for connection issues

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

### 2. SPRINT-008: Cost Optimization and Tracking
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: All providers

**Why Next:**
- ✅ Builds on all existing providers for comprehensive cost management
- ✅ Medium effort with high impact on user experience
- ✅ Critical for users managing API costs across multiple providers
- ✅ Can leverage existing session analytics and database structure

**Key Features:**
- Real-time cost tracking per provider/model/host
- Budget alerts and spending limits
- Task-specific model recommendations
- Usage analytics and projections
- Automatic model suggestions for cost optimization

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### 3. SPRINT-001B: Claude Pro/Max Authentication
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Large | **Dependencies**: SPRINT-001

**Why Deferred:**
- ✅ Implementation plan is complete and ready
- ✅ Requires careful OAuth implementation and testing
- ✅ Large effort requiring substantial development time
- ✅ Benefits specific subset of users (Claude Pro/Max subscribers)

**Implementation Ready:**
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow planned
- Session management approach defined
- Usage tracking strategy outlined
- TUI integration mapped out

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

### 4. SPRINT-010: Intelligence Learning System
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Large | **Dependencies**: SPRINT-004

**Why Later:**
- ✅ Builds on existing Intelligence Engine foundation
- ✅ Large effort requiring advanced pattern recognition
- ✅ Can benefit from more usage data after other sprints
- ✅ More experimental/research-oriented than immediate user needs

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks

- Smart project pattern recognition
- Automated workflow optimization

## Technical Considerations

### Code Quality
- ✅ Maintain 80%+ test coverage target
- ✅ Use existing testing framework with dependency injection
- ✅ Follow established patterns from existing providers
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

### Performance
- ✅ Maintain <100ms startup, <50ms response targets
- ✅ Efficient caching for model discovery and cost calculations
- ✅ Async implementation throughout
- ✅ Minimal memory footprint increases

### User Experience
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing TUI
- ✅ Clear provider/model selection in UI
- ✅ Transparent cost and usage information
- ✅ Graceful error handling and user feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### SPRINT-007 Risks
- **Ollama not installed**: Graceful degradation with clear error messages
- **Model compatibility**: Robust model discovery with fallbacks
- **Connection issues**: Proper timeout handling and retry logic

### SPRINT-008 Risks
- **Cost calculation accuracy**: Comprehensive testing with real usage data
- **Performance impact**: Efficient caching and async implementation
- **User confusion**: Clear UI and documentation

### SPRINT-001B Risks
- **OAuth complexity**: Thorough testing and error handling
- **Session management**: Secure token storage and refresh logic
- **Usage tracking**: Accurate limit monitoring and warnings

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Seamless session management with refresh
- ✅ Zero per-token costs for subscription users

## Recommendation

**Start with SPRINT-007 (Ollama Provider)** for the following reasons:

1. **Immediate Value**: Local model support with zero ongoing costs
2. **Low Risk**: No external dependencies, fully testable offline
3. **Quick Win**: Medium effort with high user impact
4. **Foundation**: Establishes local model patterns for future providers
5. **User Demand**: Growing interest in local AI models for privacy and cost

This approach provides immediate value while building toward more complex features in subsequent sprints.
