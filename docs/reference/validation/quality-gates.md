# Quality Gates and Validation Checklist

Critical requirements and quality standards for Aircher development using Rust.

## Overview

This document defines the minimum quality standards that ALL code changes must meet before being considered complete. These gates ensure reliability, security, performance, and maintainability of the Aircher CLI tool.

## Code Quality Gates

### ✅ Rust Code Standards

**Compilation & Linting**
- [ ] `cargo check` passes without errors
- [ ] `cargo clippy` passes with zero warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] `cargo fmt` shows no formatting changes needed
- [ ] No `todo!()` or `unimplemented!()` macros in production code
- [ ] All `unwrap()` calls have justification comments or use `expect()` with descriptive messages
- [ ] No `panic!()` calls except in test code or truly unrecoverable situations

**Memory Safety & Performance**
- [ ] No unnecessary `clone()` operations - use references where possible
- [ ] Proper lifetime annotations for borrowed data
- [ ] Async code uses appropriate `await` points without blocking
- [ ] No memory leaks detected in long-running operations
- [ ] Appropriate use of `Arc` and `Mutex` for shared state
- [ ] Channel usage follows Rust best practices (prefer mpsc over shared memory)

**Error Handling**
- [ ] All `Result` types are properly handled (no ignored `Result` warnings)
- [ ] Custom error types implement `std::error::Error` trait
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Error propagation uses `?` operator where appropriate
- [ ] Critical errors are logged with appropriate context

### ✅ Architecture Standards

**Trait Design**
- [ ] Traits are focused and cohesive (single responsibility)
- [ ] Generic parameters have appropriate bounds
- [ ] Trait objects use `dyn` keyword explicitly
- [ ] Async traits use `async-trait` when needed

**Module Organization**
- [ ] Public API surface is minimal and well-documented
- [ ] Internal implementation details are private
- [ ] Module dependencies form a DAG (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] Feature flags properly isolate optional functionality

**Dependency Management**
- [ ] `Cargo.toml` dependencies specify appropriate version constraints
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added
- [ ] Features are used to reduce binary size when possible
- [ ] All dependencies come from trusted sources (crates.io)

## Testing Requirements

### ✅ Test Coverage

**Unit Tests**
- [ ] Critical business logic has >90% test coverage
- [ ] All public functions have unit tests
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are tested
- [ ] Tests use descriptive names following `test_should_do_something_when_condition`
- [ ] Mock objects used for external dependencies

**Integration Tests**
- [ ] End-to-end workflows tested in `tests/` directory
- [ ] Database operations tested with isolated test databases
- [ ] TUI components tested with synthetic input/output
- [ ] API provider integrations tested (with mocking for CI)

**Test Quality**
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Test data is isolated between test runs
- [ ] Async tests properly handle timeouts
- [ ] Property-based tests for complex algorithms (using `proptest`)

### ✅ Performance Testing

**Benchmarks**
- [ ] Critical path operations have benchmarks
- [ ] Benchmark results show acceptable performance:
  - CLI startup: < 100ms cold start
  - TUI response: < 16ms for 60fps
  - API calls: < 5s timeout with proper progress indication
  - Database queries: < 10ms for typical operations
- [ ] Memory usage remains < 50MB for typical workflows
- [ ] No memory leaks in long-running sessions

## Security Requirements

### ✅ Security Validation

**Credential Management**
- [ ] API keys never logged or printed
- [ ] Credential files have restricted permissions (600)
- [ ] No credentials hardcoded in source code
- [ ] Secure deletion of sensitive data from memory
- [ ] Input validation for all user-provided data

**Dependencies**
- [ ] `cargo audit` passes with no known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies regularly updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] No deprecated or unmaintained dependencies
- [ ] Supply chain security verified for critical dependencies

**Network Security**
- [ ] All HTTP requests use HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Certificate validation is not disabled
- [ ] Request timeouts implemented to prevent DoS
- [ ] User agent string identifies application appropriately

## User Experience Standards

### ✅ CLI Interface

**Command Design**
- [ ] Commands follow Unix conventions (flags, arguments, exit codes)
- [ ] Help text is comprehensive and includes examples
- [ ] Error messages suggest corrective actions
- [ ] Progress indication for long-running operations
- [ ] Graceful handling of SIGINT/SIGTERM

**TUI Interface**
- [ ] Responsive design works on terminals 80x24 and larger
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts documented and intuitive
- [ ] Color scheme supports both light and dark terminals
- [ ] Accessible design (screen reader friendly)
- [ ] Smooth scrolling and navigation

### ✅ Configuration

**Config Management**
- [ ] Default configuration works out of the box
- [ ] Configuration validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Environment variable overrides work correctly
- [ ] Migration path for config format changes
- [ ] Sensitive settings clearly marked and protected

## Documentation Standards

## Emergency Quality Bypass

In emergency situations (critical security fixes), a subset of these gates may be bypassed with:

1. **Explicit Documentation** of which gates were bypassed and why
2. **Follow-up Tasks** created to address skipped validation
3. **Risk Assessment** of the bypass decision
4. **Approval** from project maintainer

However, these gates should NEVER be bypassed:
- [ ] Security audit for credential handling
- [ ] Basic compilation and fundamental testing
- [ ] Cross-platform build verification

**Remember**: These quality gates exist to ensure Aircher provides a reliable, secure, and excellent user experience. When in doubt, err on the side of higher quality standards.
