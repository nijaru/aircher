### Database Schema
- **✅ Conversations DB**: Messages, files, tool calls
- **✅ Knowledge DB**: Decisions, patterns, code insights  
- **✅ File Index DB**: Dependencies, changes, relevance cache
- **✅ Sessions DB**: Session context and management

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Current State
- **Build**: ✅ Compiles successfully
- **CLI**: ✅ All commands and flags work
- **Interactive Mode**: ✅ REPL starts and processes slash commands
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: ✅ Processes prompts with different output formats

### Manual Testing Completed
```bash
✅ ./aircher --help
✅ ./aircher version  
✅ ./aircher -p "hello world"
✅ ./aircher -p "test" --output-format json
✅ ./aircher (Full TUI interface with panels)
✅ TUI keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+H, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+C)
✅ TUI slash commands (/help, /clear, /cost, /think)
✅ make build && ./build/aircher version
```
