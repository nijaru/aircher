# Aircher Development Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-21

## üéâ Current State: Production Ready

The core semantic search system is now **production-ready** with professional-grade performance and reliability.

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements

#### Performance Milestones
- **99.9% faster subsequent searches**: 0.02s (from cache) vs 20s (rebuilding)
- **80% faster indexing**: 15-20s for typical projects (was 2+ minutes)
- **Complete index persistence**: Cached searches eliminate rebuild overhead
- **Zero CPU spikes**: Batch processing and cooperative multitasking
- **Production scale**: 105 files, 3,066 chunks, 100% embedding coverage

#### Technical Excellence
- **Pure Rust implementation**: No system dependencies, truly bulletproof
- **19+ language support**: Full semantic parsing with tree-sitter
- **Bundled embedding model**: SweRankEmbed included, no external downloads
- **instant-distance HNSW**: High-performance vector search
- **Hierarchical configuration**: Hardcoded ‚Üí global ‚Üí local ‚Üí environment

#### Core Features Complete
- **CLI fully functional**: All search commands working reliably
- **Index persistence**: Proper HNSW serialization and loading
- **Batch embedding generation**: Efficient processing of large codebases
- **Error recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- **Background monitoring**: Real-time file change detection

## üîÑ Current Development Phase

### Focus: Polish and User Experience

With the core engine complete and performant, the focus shifts to:

1. **Code Quality** (In Progress)
   - Clean up remaining ~200 compiler warnings
   - Improve code organization and documentation
   - Enhance test coverage

2. **User Experience** (Next Priority)
   - Better search result display and context
   - Enhanced error messages and help text
   - Query suggestions and refinements

## üìã Next Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Immediate Enhancements (1-2 weeks)
1. **Search Result Quality**
   - Improve context display around matches
   - Add code syntax highlighting
   - Show file structure context

2. **Query Intelligence**
   - Query suggestions based on codebase
   - "Did you mean?" functionality
   - Search history and favorites

3. **TUI Demo Mode**
   - Allow trying the interface without API keys
   - Use local models for demonstration
   - Interactive tutorial mode

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (2-4 weeks)
1. **MCP Client Integration**
   - Connect to other MCP servers
   - Use external tools and capabilities
   - Unified tool interface

2. **Cross-file Intelligence**
   - Detect relationships between files
   - Understand architectural patterns
   - Suggest refactoring opportunities

3. **Advanced Search Modes**
   - Search by code patterns
   - Find similar implementations
   - Security vulnerability detection

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (4-6 weeks)
1. **MCP Server Mode**
   - Expose Aircher as MCP server
   - Allow other tools to use search
   - API for external integrations

2. **IDE Plugins**
   - VS Code extension
   - Neovim integration
   - JetBrains plugin

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions
   - GitLab CI
   - Build system plugins

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

### Search Performance
- **First search (cold)**: 15-20 seconds (builds index)
- **Subsequent searches**: 0.02 seconds (from cache)
- **Index size**: ~50MB for 3,000 chunks
- **Memory usage**: <200MB typical

### Language Support
19+ languages with full semantic parsing:
- Systems: Rust, C, C++, Go
- Web: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, PHP
- Enterprise: Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift
- Others: Bash, SQL, TOML, JSON, YAML, Markdown

## üêõ Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Compiler warnings**: ~200 warnings to clean up
2. **Error messages**: Some could be more user-friendly
3. **Documentation**: API docs need updating

### Non-Critical
1. **Large file handling**: Files >10MB need optimization
2. **Binary file detection**: Could be more robust
3. **Progress indicators**: Could show more detail

## üèÜ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Sub-second search responses achieved
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: No crashes or data loss in testing
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Handles real-world codebases efficiently
- ‚úÖ **Usability**: CLI is intuitive and responsive
- ‚úÖ **Compatibility**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Index your project (one-time, 15-20s)
aircher search index

# Search instantly (0.02s)
aircher search query "error handling"
aircher search query "database connection"
aircher search query "async functions"
```

## üìù Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **instant-distance**: Chosen for pure Rust implementation
- **SweRankEmbed**: Best size/performance for code understanding
- **Tree-sitter**: Proven solution for language parsing
- **Batch processing**: Critical for performance at scale

### Lessons Learned
- Index persistence is crucial for user experience
- Batch embedding generation provides 5-10x speedup
- Cache directory standardization prevents issues
- CPU yielding improves system responsiveness

### Future Considerations
- Consider upgrading to larger embedding models
- Explore GPU acceleration for enterprise scale
- Investigate distributed indexing options
- Research advanced code understanding models
