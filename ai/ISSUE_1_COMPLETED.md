# Issue 1 COMPLETED: Memory Systems Wired into Execution Path ‚úÖ

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for testing
**Files Modified**: `src/agent/core.rs` (+147 lines)

---

## Summary

Successfully integrated all 3 memory systems (episodic memory, knowledge graph, working memory) into the Agent execution path. Memory is now queried before every LLM call and results are added to the system prompt.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Memory Query Logic (Lines 384-484 in core.rs)

**Episodic Memory Integration**:
- Queries file history for recently mentioned files
- Extracts file paths from user message (.rs, .py, .ts, .js, .go)
- Retrieves last 5 interactions per file
- Shows operation type, timestamp, success/failure
- Includes context from past interactions

**Knowledge Graph Integration**:
- Searches for mentioned symbols (functions, classes)
- Looks for capitalized or snake_case words
- Finds symbol definitions across codebase
- Shows callers (what functions call this)
- Displays file locations

**Co-Edit Pattern Detection**:
- Queries for files often edited together
- Uses last 60 minutes window
- Shows confidence scores
- Helps predict related files

### 2. Memory Context Addition to Prompt (Lines 584-589)

Memory context is added to system prompt in structured format:
```
## Memory System Context:

## Past Interactions with file.rs:
- read at 2025-10-29 10:30 (success)
  Context: User asked about authentication

## Knowledge Graph - Symbol 'AuthManager':
- Class 'AuthManager' in src/auth.rs
  Called by 5 other functions

## Frequently Co-Edited Files:
- Files: src/auth.rs, src/api.rs (confidence: 85%)
```

### 3. Episodic Memory Recording (Lines 771-808)

After tool execution, records to episodic memory:
- **File operations**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_files
- **Metadata tracked**:
  - Tool name and operation type
  - File path and success/failure
  - User request context (first 200 chars)
  - Timestamp and session ID
  - Changes summary or error message

### 4. Logging & Observability

Added comprehensive debug/info logging:
- Memory query start
- Files/symbols found
- Knowledge graph hits
- Memory context size (chars)
- Recording success/failure

---

## Code Changes Detail

### Location 1: Memory Queries (core.rs:384-484)

**File History Query**:
```rust
match self.intelligence.get_file_history(word, 5).await {
    Ok(history) if !history.is_empty() => {
        debug!("Found {} past interactions with {}", history.len(), word);
        // Format and add to memory_context
    }
}
```

**Knowledge Graph Query**:
```rust
if let Some(ref kg) = self.intelligence.knowledge_graph {
    let kg_guard = kg.lock().await;
    match kg_guard.find_symbol(word) {
        Ok(nodes) if !nodes.is_empty() => {
            // Show functions/classes in files
            // Find callers
        }
    }
}
```

**Co-Edit Patterns**:
```rust
if let Ok(patterns) = self.intelligence.find_co_edit_patterns(60).await {
    // Show files edited together with confidence
}
```

### Location 2: Context Addition (core.rs:584-589)

```rust
if !memory_context.is_empty() {
    system_prompt.push_str("\n\n## Memory System Context:\n");
    system_prompt.push_str(&memory_context);
    info!("Memory context added to system prompt ({} chars)", memory_context.len());
}
```

### Location 3: Recording (core.rs:771-808)

```rust
let interaction = crate::intelligence::duckdb_memory::FileInteraction {
    id: uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string(),
    timestamp: chrono::Utc::now(),
    session_id: session_id.clone(),
    file_path: path.to_string(),
    operation: operation.to_string(),
    success: output.success,
    context: Some(user_message.chars().take(200).collect()),
    changes_summary: /* ... */,
};

match self.intelligence.record_file_interaction(interaction).await {
    Ok(_) => debug!("Recorded file interaction in episodic memory"),
    Err(e) => warn!("Failed to record: {}", e),
}
```

---

## Expected Impact

### Claim 1: 60% Tool Call Reduction

**How This Helps**:
- **File history**: Agent sees past interactions, avoids re-reading same files
- **Knowledge graph**: Instant answers like "what calls this?" without grep
- **Co-edit patterns**: Predicts related files, fewer exploratory reads

**Example**:
- User: "Fix bug in auth.rs"
- Memory shows: "auth.rs last edited 1 hour ago for similar issue"
- Knowledge graph shows: "AuthManager is used in 5 files"
- Co-edit pattern shows: "auth.rs and api.rs often edited together"
- **Result**: Agent knows context without reading multiple files

### Before vs After

**Before (without memory)**:
1. read_file auth.rs
2. search_code for AuthManager
3. list_files to find related files
4. read_file api.rs, read_file middleware.rs
5. grep for usage patterns
**Total**: ~7 tool calls

**After (with memory)**:
1. Check memory: "auth.rs last edited, uses AuthManager, related to api.rs"
2. read_file auth.rs (informed by memory)
3. edit_file auth.rs (knows what to fix)
**Total**: ~3 tool calls (60% reduction)

---

## What Still Needs Work

### 1. Memory Initialization ‚ö†Ô∏è

Currently memory systems (duckdb, knowledge graph) are **optional** in IntelligenceEngine:
```rust
duckdb_memory: Option<Arc<Mutex<DuckDBMemory>>>,
knowledge_graph: Option<Arc<Mutex<KnowledgeGraph>>>,
```

**Need to verify**:
- Are these initialized on agent startup?
- Check `IntelligenceEngine::new()` or `initialize_duckdb_memory()`
- If None, queries return nothing (gracefully handled)

### 2. Session Management üîß

Currently using placeholder:
```rust
let session_id = "current_session".to_string(); // TODO
```

**Need to implement**:
- Actual session ID tracking
- Task ID tracking for multi-turn tasks
- Session start/end recording

### 3. Knowledge Graph Building üìä

Knowledge graph needs to be built from codebase:
```rust
intelligence.build_knowledge_graph(project_root).await?;
```

**Where to trigger**:
- On agent startup? (slow for large codebases)
- Background thread? (incremental building)
- User command? (/index or similar)

### 4. Better Symbol Extraction üîç

Current symbol detection is basic:
```rust
if word.len() > 3 && (word.chars().next().unwrap().is_uppercase() || word.contains('_'))
```

**Improvements needed**:
- Use NLP or regex for better function/class detection
- Handle qualified names (e.g., `std::sync::Mutex`)
- Extract from code snippets in messages

---

## Testing Plan

### Test 1: File History Query

**Setup**:
1. Edit a file (e.g., src/agent/core.rs)
2. Ask: "What did I change in core.rs?"

**Expected**:
- Memory query logs show file history retrieval
- System prompt includes past interactions
- Agent responds with knowledge of past edits

### Test 2: Knowledge Graph Query

**Setup**:
1. Build knowledge graph for Aircher codebase
2. Ask: "How does IntelligenceEngine work?"

**Expected**:
- Memory query finds symbol "IntelligenceEngine"
- Shows file location, callers
- Agent provides informed answer

### Test 3: Co-Edit Patterns

**Setup**:
1. Edit auth.rs and api.rs within 60 minutes
2. Ask: "Fix auth bug"

**Expected**:
- Co-edit pattern detected
- Suggests api.rs as related file
- Agent checks both files

### Test 4: Memory Recording

**Setup**:
1. Use tools: read_file, write_file, edit_file
2. Check logs for recording confirmations

**Expected**:
- See "Recorded file interaction in episodic memory" logs
- Future queries return these interactions

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Code compiles without errors ‚úÖ
- [x] Memory queries integrated into execution path ‚úÖ
- [x] Context added to system prompt ‚úÖ
- [x] Recording happens after tool execution ‚úÖ
- [ ] Memory systems initialized on startup ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] Test with real query (manual validation)
- [ ] Verify logs show memory queries
- [ ] Measure tool call reduction

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. **Test memory integration with real query**
   - Build knowledge graph: `intelligence.build_knowledge_graph(project_root).await`
   - Initialize DuckDB: `intelligence.initialize_duckdb_memory(project_root).await`
   - Run test query and check logs

2. **Fix Issue 2: LSP Diagnostics Feedback**
   - Implement diagnostics consumption after file edits
   - Add to agent context for self-correction
   - Test with intentional syntax error

3. **Fix Issue 4: Git Rollback**
   - Implement rollback on tool failure
   - Test with bad edit operation

### Tomorrow:
- Run Scenario 1 (multi-file refactoring) benchmark
- Measure tool call reduction with/without memory
- Validate 60% reduction claim

## Logs to Watch For

When testing, look for these log lines:

```
INFO Querying memory systems for relevant context
DEBUG Found 3 past interactions with core.rs
DEBUG Knowledge graph found 2 nodes for symbol 'Agent'
DEBUG Found 1 co-edit patterns
INFO Added 456 chars of memory context to prompt
DEBUG Recorded file interaction for core.rs in episodic memory
```

If you see these, memory integration is working! üéâ
