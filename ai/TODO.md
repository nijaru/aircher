## Week 7: Core Architecture Patterns (Current Sprint)

### Day 1-2: Event Bus + LSP Integration
- [ ] Implement tokio::sync::broadcast event bus
- [ ] Create Event enum (FileChanged, DiagnosticsReceived, TestResults, ToolExecuted)
- [ ] LspManager with global HashMap<PathBuf, Vec<Diagnostic>>
- [ ] LSP server spawning (rust-analyzer, pyright, gopls, typescript-language-server)
- [ ] JSON-RPC communication over stdio
- [ ] Hook edit_file tool to trigger LSP notifications
- [ ] Event bus integration with agent context
- [ ] Test: Edit file â†’ LSP diagnostics â†’ Agent receives via event bus

**Expected Outcome**: Real-time diagnostics after every file edit

### Day 3-4: Plan/Build Mode Separation
- [ ] Create AgentMode enum (Plan { read_only_tools }, Build { all_tools })
- [ ] Update Agent struct to track current mode
- [ ] Implement mode-specific tool filtering
- [ ] Plan mode: only grep, read, glob, LSP queries allowed
- [ ] Build mode: all tools including write, edit, bash
- [ ] Add mode transition logic based on UserIntent
- [ ] System prompt per mode (different instructions)
- [ ] Test: Plan mode rejects write operations, Build mode allows

**Expected Outcome**: Safe exploration in Plan mode, controlled modifications in Build mode

### Day 5: Git Snapshots
- [ ] Create SnapshotManager using git2 crate
- [ ] Implement create_snapshot() - temporary detached commit
- [ ] Implement rollback() - hard reset to snapshot
- [ ] Auto-snapshot before bash commands
- [ ] Auto-snapshot before bulk file edits
- [ ] Rollback on permission rejection
- [ ] Test: Make risky change â†’ error â†’ auto-rollback â†’ state restored

**Expected Outcome**: 100% recovery from failed operations

### Day 6-7: Model Router
- [ ] Create ModelRouter with HashMap<AgentType, ModelConfig>
- [ ] Implement select_model() based on task complexity
- [ ] Simple tasks â†’ Claude Haiku (fast, cheap)
- [ ] Complex reasoning â†’ Claude Opus 4.1 (best)
- [ ] Research sub-agents â†’ Claude Haiku (cheap parallelization)
- [ ] Track costs per model usage
- [ ] Test: Compare costs with/without routing

**Expected Outcome**: 40% cost reduction via intelligent routing

### Completed Weeks (Timeline)

- 4 production tools: read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_files
- 2,110+ lines of code, 21+ tests
- Competitive parity: 17-21% â†’ 23-27%

**âœ… Week 2: Code Understanding (Skipped - tools already exist)**

- Hybrid architecture combining best patterns

## Week 8: Specialized Agents + Sub-Agents

### Day 1-2: Agent Configurations
- [ ] Create AgentConfig struct (agent_type, system_prompt, allowed_tools, max_steps)
- [ ] Define Explorer agent (CodeReading tasks)
  - System prompt: "You are a code explorer. Your goal is to understand code, find patterns, and explain functionality."
  - Tools: grep, read, glob, LSP, knowledge_graph_query
- [ ] Define Builder agent (CodeWriting tasks)
  - System prompt: "You are a code builder. Implement features precisely, follow existing patterns."
  - Tools: all tools including write, edit
- [ ] Define Debugger agent (ProjectFixing tasks)
  - System prompt: "You are a debugger. Find root causes, fix bugs systematically."
  - Tools: all tools + test runner
- [ ] Define Refactorer agent (code improvements)
  - System prompt: "You are a refactorer. Improve code while maintaining behavior."
  - Tools: read, write, edit, test runner, LSP
- [ ] Test: Each agent type with specialized task

**Expected Outcome**: Specialized agents with focused, effective prompts

### Day 3-4: Research Sub-Agents
- [ ] Implement SubAgent::spawn() for parallel research
- [ ] Task decomposition: break research query into subtasks
- [ ] Max 10 concurrent sub-agents (Claude Code limit)
- [ ] Result aggregation in main agent context
- [ ] Memory integration: check episodic memory before spawning
- [ ] Prevent duplicate research (cache hit = skip sub-agent)
- [ ] Test: "Find all auth patterns" â†’ 5 parallel sub-agents search directories

**Expected Outcome**: 90% speedup for research tasks, memory prevents duplicates

### Day 5-7: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test Plan mode with research sub-agents
  - Verify: Read-only tools, can spawn sub-agents
  - Measure: Research task completion time vs baseline
- [ ] Test Build mode NEVER uses sub-agents
  - Verify: 0% sub-agent usage for coding tasks
  - Measure: No 15x token waste
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
  - Start in Plan â†’ research with sub-agents â†’ transition to Build â†’ implement
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
  - Tool calls: target 60% reduction
  - Research speed: target 90% improvement
  - Token usage: confirm no sub-agents for coding

**Expected Outcome**: Validated 90% research improvement, 0% coding sub-agents

## Week 9: Benchmarks vs Claude Code

**Goal**: Validate 60% improvement from memory systems

**Benchmark Tasks**:
1. Multi-file refactoring (measure: tool calls, context efficiency)
2. Bug fixing workflow (measure: time to resolution, relevant files)
3. New feature implementation (measure: code consistency, iterations)
4. Codebase exploration (measure: irrelevant files examined)

**Metrics to Track**:
- Tool calls needed (target: 7.5 â†’ 3.0 = 60% reduction)
- Files examined (target: 7.5 â†’ 3.0 = 60% reduction)
- Irrelevant files (target: 3.5 â†’ 0.0 = 100% reduction)
- Success rate (target: maintain 100%)
- Continuous work capability (no restart needed)

**Validation Plan**:
1. Run same 4 tasks from Python POC in Rust
2. Compare Aircher (with memory) vs Claude Code (no memory)
3. Document: tool call traces, context window usage, memory queries
4. Create graphs and tables for research paper
