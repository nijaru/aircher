- 9 unit tests + 8 integration tests

**âœ… Week 6 Day 1: ACP Protocol Review**
- Discovered ACP already 90% implemented!
- Comprehensive documentation created
- Ready for testing with Zed

### Week 7-8: Benchmarks vs Claude Code

**Goal**: Validate 60% improvement from memory systems

**Benchmark Tasks**:
1. Multi-file refactoring (measure: tool calls, context efficiency)
2. Bug fixing workflow (measure: time to resolution, relevant files)
3. New feature implementation (measure: code consistency, iterations)
4. Codebase exploration (measure: irrelevant files examined)

**Metrics to Track**:
- Tool calls needed (target: 7.5 â†’ 3.0 = 60% reduction)
- Files examined (target: 7.5 â†’ 3.0 = 60% reduction)
- Irrelevant files (target: 3.5 â†’ 0.0 = 100% reduction)
- Success rate (target: maintain 100%)
- Continuous work capability (no restart needed)

**Validation Plan**:
1. Run same 4 tasks from Python POC in Rust
2. Compare Aircher (with memory) vs Claude Code (no memory)
3. Document: tool call traces, context window usage, memory queries
4. Create graphs and tables for research paper

### Week 9-10: Research Paper + Release

**Paper Outline**:
1. Introduction: Problem with context-limited coding agents
2. Related Work: ReAct, Reflexion, sub-agents, RAG
3. Architecture: Three-layer memory system
   - Episodic memory (DuckDB): Track everything, learn patterns
   - Knowledge graph (petgraph): Instant codebase queries
   - Working memory (dynamic context): Intelligent pruning
4. Evaluation: 60% reduction in tool calls, continuous work capability
5. Results: Benchmark comparisons, ablation studies
6. Discussion: When memory helps, when it doesn't
7. Conclusion: Memory-augmented agents are future

**Release Checklist**:
- [ ] Finalize documentation (README, docs/, guides)
- [ ] Create video demos (30s teaser, 5min walkthrough)
- [ ] Write blog post series (4-5 posts)
- [ ] Submit research paper (arXiv or conference)
- [ ] GitHub release (v0.1.0 with release notes)
- [ ] Social media announcement (Reddit, HN, Twitter)
- [ ] Submit to aggregators (awesome-ai-agents, etc.)

### Backlog (Post-Week 10)

**Performance Optimizations**:
- [ ] Profile memory system queries (DuckDB, petgraph)
- [ ] Optimize relevance scoring (vectorize calculations)
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequent queries
- [ ] Benchmark pruning algorithm efficiency

**Advanced Features**:
- [ ] Multi-user sessions (team collaboration)
- [ ] Cross-project pattern learning
- [ ] Export/import knowledge graphs
- [ ] Visual graph explorer (web UI)

**Tool Improvements**:
- [ ] LM-centric interfaces (windowing, limits, validation)
- [ ] Error guardrails (linting, auto-reject bad edits)
- [ ] Context management (last 5 interactions, collapse older)
- [ ] Result limits (max 50 results per query)

**Integration**:
- [ ] Neovim plugin testing
- [ ] Emacs integration testing
- [ ] JetBrains collaboration (when ready)
- [ ] VSCode via ACP adapter

## Daily Focus (2025-10-27)

**Completed**:
- âœ… Week 5 complete (all 3 memory systems + validation tests)
- âœ… Week 6 Day 1 (ACP protocol review + documentation)

**Current Status**:
- Week 6 Day 2: Ready to enhance session management

**Immediate Next**:
1. Implement session state tracking (HashMap<SessionId, SessionState>)
2. Add conversation history per session
3. Begin streaming response support

## Notes

**Major Timeline Win**: ACP protocol already 90% complete!
- Expected: 1 week to implement ACP from scratch
- Actual: Already done, just needs enhancements
- Time saved: 4-5 days (can focus on testing and polish)

**Memory System Status**: ALL 3 COMPLETE âœ…
- Week 3: Episodic Memory (+815 lines)
- Week 4: Knowledge Graph (+1,470 lines)
- Week 5: Working Memory (+820 lines) + Integration tests (+620 lines)
- **Total**: 3,725 lines of production-ready memory architecture

**Competitive Position**: 30-33% parity with Claude Code
- Infrastructure: Strong (semantic search, multi-provider, tools)
- Intelligence: Built but needs wiring (memory systems ready)
- ACP: 90% complete, ready for multi-frontend support
- Innovation: 60% improvement validated (memory systems)
