## Week 9: Empirical Validation (Current Sprint)

### Priority 0: Model Routing Improvements (COMPLETED Oct 29, 2025) ✅
**Phase 1 Complete**: Core model routing infrastructure working

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] **Fix model names** (Commit: 9423e55)
  - Updated to claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-haiku-4-5
  - Verified exact API strings from Anthropic documentation
  - Updated all ModelConfig constructors in src/agent/model_router.rs

- [x] **Update routing table to favor Sonnet 4.5** (Commit: 9423e55)
  - All agent types now use Sonnet 4.5 for medium/high complexity (not Opus)
  - Only sub-agents use Haiku 4.5 for cheap parallelization
  - Opus 4.1 removed from routing (Sonnet better for most/all tasks)

- [x] **Add single model override support** (Commit: 9423e55)
  - Added single_model_override field to ModelRouter
  - Implemented with_single_model(), set_single_model(), clear_single_model()
  - User can bypass routing table and use one model for everything

- [x] **Update Config struct** (Commit: d411998)
  - Added ModelRoutingConfig struct with provider, single_model, use_exacto fields
  - Added to ConfigManager with Default implementation
  - Defaults to smart routing (zero config required)

- [x] **Integrate with Agent initialization** (Commit: 507bcc4)
  - Agent checks config.model_routing.single_model on startup
  - If set, creates ModelRouter with single model
  - If not set, uses smart routing by default
  - Supports both hyphen and dot notation (claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-sonnet-4.5)

**Remaining Tasks** (Phase 2 - Future):
- [ ] Add provider-specific model configs for OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter
  - TODO comment in src/agent/core.rs:169
- [ ] Test with actual execution and different providers
- [ ] Verify logs show correct model selection

**Current State**:
- ✅ Smart routing works with correct Anthropic model names
- ✅ Single model override works via config
- ✅ Ready for empirical validation (no longer blocked)

**Details**: See ai/MODEL_CONFIG_PLAN.md for Phase 2 plans

### Priority 1: Integration Validation (COMPLETED Oct 30, 2025) ✅

- Context windows and model configs ✅

**Expected Outcome**: ✅ ACHIEVED - Automated tests validate core integration logic

### Priority 3: Pragmatic Validation via Benchmarks (NEW APPROACH - Oct 30, 2025)

**Decision**: Stop trying to prove theoretical improvements (60% reduction, 90% speedup). Instead, validate agent works on real tasks via standardized benchmarks.

**Target**: Terminal-Bench (80 tasks, terminal/CLI focused)
- **Current SOTA**: Factory Droid 58.8%, Claude Code 43.2%
- **Realistic Goal**: 35-45% (match Claude Code baseline)
- **Stretch Goal**: 45-55% (approach Factory Droid)

**Setup** (COMPLETED Oct 30):
- [x] Created Dockerfile.bench (containerized environment)
- [x] Created scripts/run-benchmark.sh (helper script)
- [x] Created ai/BENCHMARK_SETUP.md (comprehensive guide)
- [x] Added benchmark-results/ to .gitignore

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Validate integration (10 tasks, 30 min)
  ```bash
  ./scripts/run-benchmark.sh phase1
  ```
  - Proves: ACP protocol works, container setup correct, Aircher responds
  - Success: At least 1 task completes (pass/fail doesn't matter)

- [ ] **Phase 2**: Baseline run (80 tasks, 4-6 hours)
  ```bash
  ./scripts/run-benchmark.sh phase2
  ```
  - Proves: Agent can handle real tasks, establish competitive position
  - Success: >25% (working), >35% (competitive), >45% (strong)

- [ ] **Analysis**: Document results in ai/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md
  - Overall success rate
  - Failure modes (what types of tasks fail)
  - Competitive positioning
  - Honest assessment

**Expected Outcome**:
- ✅ Empirical proof agent works on real tasks (not just unit tests)
- ✅ Objective competitive comparison (vs Claude Code, Factory Droid)
- ✅ Clear understanding of strengths and weaknesses

**What This Proves**:
- Agent completes real tasks (file ops, git, debugging)
- ACP protocol works in practice
- Tool implementations functional
- Competitive positioning

**What This Doesn't Prove**:
- 60% tool reduction (would need A/B with/without memory)
- 90% research speedup (benchmarks don't isolate research)
- Memory advantages (benchmarks are stateless)

**Why This Approach**: Pragmatic validation of actual capabilities vs theoretical improvements

**Details**: See ai/BENCHMARK_SETUP.md

### Priority 4: Performance Measurements (Deferred)

**Status**: Skipping component-level benchmarks in favor of end-to-end validation

**Rationale**: Terminal-Bench provides more valuable validation than micro-benchmarks of:
- Model selection overhead (irrelevant if agent can't complete tasks)
- Event bus latency (already tested in integration tests)
- Memory query speed (not the bottleneck)

**If Terminal-Bench shows >35%**: Agent is competitive, component optimizations can wait
**If Terminal-Bench shows <25%**: Fix core functionality, not performance

### Completed Weeks (Timeline)

## Week 8: Specialized Agents + Sub-Agents

### Day 1-2: Agent Configurations
- [ ] Create AgentConfig struct (agent_type, system_prompt, allowed_tools, max_steps)
- [ ] Define Explorer agent (CodeReading tasks)
  - System prompt: "You are a code explorer. Your goal is to understand code, find patterns, and explain functionality."
  - Tools: grep, read, glob, LSP, knowledge_graph_query
- [ ] Define Builder agent (CodeWriting tasks)
  - System prompt: "You are a code builder. Implement features precisely, follow existing patterns."
  - Tools: all tools including write, edit
- [ ] Define Debugger agent (ProjectFixing tasks)
  - System prompt: "You are a debugger. Find root causes, fix bugs systematically."
  - Tools: all tools + test runner
- [ ] Define Refactorer agent (code improvements)
  - System prompt: "You are a refactorer. Improve code while maintaining behavior."
  - Tools: read, write, edit, test runner, LSP
- [ ] Test: Each agent type with specialized task

**Expected Outcome**: Specialized agents with focused, effective prompts

### Day 3-4: Research Sub-Agents
- [ ] Implement SubAgent::spawn() for parallel research
- [ ] Task decomposition: break research query into subtasks
- [ ] Max 10 concurrent sub-agents (Claude Code limit)
- [ ] Result aggregation in main agent context
- [ ] Memory integration: check episodic memory before spawning
- [ ] Prevent duplicate research (cache hit = skip sub-agent)
- [ ] Test: "Find all auth patterns" → 5 parallel sub-agents search directories

**Expected Outcome**: 90% speedup for research tasks, memory prevents duplicates

### Day 5-7: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test Plan mode with research sub-agents
  - Verify: Read-only tools, can spawn sub-agents
  - Measure: Research task completion time vs baseline
- [ ] Test Build mode NEVER uses sub-agents
  - Verify: 0% sub-agent usage for coding tasks
  - Measure: No 15x token waste
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
  - Start in Plan → research with sub-agents → transition to Build → implement
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
  - Tool calls: target 60% reduction
  - Research speed: target 90% improvement
  - Token usage: confirm no sub-agents for coding

**Expected Outcome**: Validated 90% research improvement, 0% coding sub-agents

## Week 9: Benchmarks vs Claude Code

**Goal**: Validate 60% improvement from memory systems

**Benchmark Tasks**:
1. Multi-file refactoring (measure: tool calls, context efficiency)
2. Bug fixing workflow (measure: time to resolution, relevant files)
3. New feature implementation (measure: code consistency, iterations)
4. Codebase exploration (measure: irrelevant files examined)

**Metrics to Track**:
- Tool calls needed (target: 7.5 → 3.0 = 60% reduction)
- Files examined (target: 7.5 → 3.0 = 60% reduction)
- Irrelevant files (target: 3.5 → 0.0 = 100% reduction)
- Success rate (target: maintain 100%)
- Continuous work capability (no restart needed)

**Validation Plan**:
1. Run same 4 tasks from Python POC in Rust
2. Compare Aircher (with memory) vs Claude Code (no memory)
3. Document: tool call traces, context window usage, memory queries
4. Create graphs and tables for research paper

### Week 9-10: Research Paper + Release
