# STATUS

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27 (POC Validation Complete - Session Paused)

## Current State

### Week 1 Complete ✅ → Python POC Started
- **4 production file tools** implemented (2,110+ lines, 21+ tests)
- **Competitive parity**: 23-27% (up from 17-21%)
- **Strategic pivot**: Building Python POC to validate memory approach
- **POC location**: `poc-memory-agent/` directory

### What Works
**Core Infrastructure**:
- Semantic Search: 6,468 vectors, 19+ languages, <2ms search latency
- Multi-Provider Auth: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama
- Tree-sitter parsing: 19+ languages for syntax highlighting
- Tool framework: End-to-end execution without crashes

**5 Real Tools** (production-ready):
1. analyze_errors (378 lines): Pattern matching, actionable suggestions
2. read_file (430 lines): Syntax highlighting, AST context extraction
3. write_file (450 lines): Atomic writes, backups, protected files
4. edit_file (530 lines): Dual modes (search/replace + line-based)
5. list_files (700 lines): Recursive traversal, filtering, metadata

### What Doesn't Work Yet
- **5/10 tools are stubs**: Returning hardcoded JSON
- **ACP Protocol**: Not implemented (Week 3)
- **Intelligence wiring**: Code exists but not in execution path
  - DuckDBMemory built but not connected
  - Episodic memory not recording
  - Pattern learning not active
- **Code understanding tools**: Week 2 target

### Known Issues
**LM-Centric Interface Problems** (Research-identified):
1. ❌ read_file returns entire files (should window to 100 lines max)
2. ❌ No linting/validation in edit_file (should auto-reject syntax errors)
3. ❌ No result limits in search (should max 50 results)
4. ❌ No context management (should keep last 5 interactions)

**Memory Systems Not Active**:
- DuckDB infrastructure complete but not wired to execution
- No episodic recording of tool calls
- No pattern retrieval before execution
- No repository auto-scanning

## What Worked

### Week 1 Execution
- **Planning accuracy**: 10-week roadmap structure working
- **Tool implementation**: All 4 tools completed on schedule
- **Quality focus**: Production-ready code, comprehensive tests
- **Documentation**: Clear status tracking enabled progress

### Architecture Decisions
- **Rust backend**: 86K lines invested, correct choice
- **ACP-first**: Right strategy vs building TUI
- **Enhanced prompting** over complex orchestration (1685-line savings)
- **Memory systems** built proactively (ready for Week 2)

## What Didn't Work

### Over-Engineering
- Built MultiTurnReasoningEngine (1685 lines) - research showed models do this internally
- Solution: Removed, replaced with enhanced prompting (300 lines)

### Missing Research Application
- Research shows LM-centric interfaces matter 3-5x
- We built tools without windowing, limits, validation
- Need to retrofit Week 1 tools with research patterns

## Active Work

**Current (2025-10-27)**: Python POC - ✅ **VALIDATED!**

**Results**: Benchmark shows **60% improvement** (exceeded 25-40% hypothesis!)
- Tool calls: 7.5 → 3.0 (-60%)
- Files examined: 7.5 → 3.0 (-60%)
- Irrelevant files: 3.5 → 0.0 (-100%)
- Success rate: 100% → 100% (same accuracy, far fewer operations)

**POC Components Complete**:
- ✅ Knowledge graph: 3,942 nodes, 5,217 edges from Aircher codebase
- ✅ Episodic memory: SQLite tracking with pattern learning
- ✅ Benchmark: 4 realistic coding tasks validated
- ✅ Integration: Graph + memory working together

**Next Steps**: Port to Rust (3-4 weeks), integrate with Aircher, wire ACP, blog posts

## Blockers

**None currently**

## Metrics

### Competitive Position
- Claude Code parity: 23-27% (target: 30-35% by Week 2 end)
- Tools: 5/10 real (target: 9/10 by Week 2 end)
- Tests: 21+ passing
- Build: Clean (zero warnings)

### Code Stats
- Rust files: 214
- Total lines: 86,781
- Real tool lines: 2,110 (production-quality)
- Test coverage: Comprehensive for implemented tools

### Infrastructure vs Capabilities
- ✅ Strong foundation (semantic search, multi-provider, parsing)
- ⚠️ Intelligence built but not connected (2,000+ lines unused)
- ❌ Need to wire memory, fix interfaces, add code tools
