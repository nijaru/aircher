# STATUS

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-04 (SWE-bench Lite Setup In Progress)

## Current State

### SWE-bench Lite Setup IN PROGRESS 🔄 → Validation Framework Ready

**Started (Nov 4, 2025)**:
- ✅ **Environment Setup**: SWE-bench installed with all dependencies
  - Repository: /tmp/SWE-bench
  - Python 3.14.0 verified
  - System: 788GB disk, 128GB RAM, 16 cores (adequate for evaluation)
- ✅ **Dataset Loaded**: 10 tasks from SWE-bench Lite selected
  - Total available: 300 tasks in Lite
  - Sample: 6 astropy + 4 django tasks
  - Saved to: /tmp/swe_bench_lite_10_tasks.json
- ✅ **Integration Script Created**: Framework for Aircher evaluation
  - Script: /tmp/SWE-bench/aircher_integration.py
  - Connects vLLM backend to SWE-bench harness

**Next Steps** (Realistic Breakdown):
1. **Repository Setup**: Clone repos at base_commit for each task
2. **Aircher Execution**: Run agent to generate patches
3. **Patch Application**: Apply generated patches
4. **Test Execution**: Run FAIL_TO_PASS and PASS_TO_PASS tests
5. **Manual Pilot**: Test with 1-2 tasks before full automation

**Task Structure Example** (astropy__astropy-12907):
- Repository: astropy/astropy
- Base commit: d16bfe05a744909de4b27f5875fe0d4ed41ce607
- Problem: Modeling's `separability_matrix` nested CompoundModels bug
- Gold patch: 200+ lines unified diff
- Tests: FAIL_TO_PASS + PASS_TO_PASS test suites

**Challenge**: Full SWE-bench evaluation is complex
- Requires Docker for test isolation
- Each task needs repo setup + patch application + test execution
- Estimated time: ~1-2 days for full automation
- Recommendation: Start with manual 1-2 task pilot

### vLLM GPU Integration COMPLETE ✅ → 6-8x Performance Improvement!

**Completed (Nov 4, 2025)** - Commit: f453893
- ✅ **OpenAI Provider Enhanced**: Added vLLM compatibility
  - Dynamic `base_url` support for custom endpoints
  - Handles vLLM-specific response fields (reasoning_content, service_tier, etc.)
  - Fixed JSON deserialization for extended API format
- ✅ **Successfully Tested**: vLLM server on Fedora (RTX 4090)
  - Model: openai/gpt-oss-20b
  - Endpoint: http://100.93.39.25:11435/v1
  - Authentication: Bearer token working
- ✅ **Performance Validated**:
  - **Average latency**: 1.16 seconds per request
  - **vs Ollama (M3 Max)**: 6-8x speedup (1.16s vs 7-10s)
  - **Better than expected**: Target was 3-4x, achieved 6-8x

**Configuration**:
```toml
[providers.openai]
base_url = "http://100.93.39.25:11435/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

**Impact**:
- GPU acceleration now available for development/testing
- Significantly faster iteration cycles
- Cost-effective inference (local RTX 4090 vs API calls)
- Opens path for SWE-bench validation (cost was blocking)

### Context Awareness Phase 1-2 COMPLETE ✅ → User Insight + Inspection Tool!

**Completed (Oct 31, 2025)**:
- ✅ **Phase 1: Context Stats in System Prompt** (Commits: 146144b, 800ca3f)
  - Agent now exposes context stats to model in every turn
  - Model sees: "45K/180K tokens used (25.1% full)"
  - Enables informed decision-making about verbosity and strategy
  - Addresses user insight: "Claude should know how much context is left"
- ✅ **Phase 2: list_context Tool** (Commit: a3d3e05)
  - Agent can now inspect conversation context items
  - Shows token usage, utilization %, remaining capacity
  - Lists items by relevance with scores
  - Provides recommendations based on utilization
  - Registered via new register_late() method for tools with dependencies
- ✅ **Component Validation** (Tasks 1-4 complete)
  - Analyzed src/agent/core.rs structure (22 fields, 20+ API methods)
  - Created src/utils/context_stats.rs formatting utility (102 lines, 3 tests)
  - Fixed test_needs_pruning bug (>= threshold fix)
  - All changes committed and building successfully
- 📄 **User Feedback Addressed**: Context stats now visible to model for smart resource management

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses `DynamicContextManager.get_context_summary()` for token usage stats
- Appended to system prompt after memory context section
- Format: Clear, actionable guidance for model behavior adaptation
- Logging: Context stats logged on every turn for debugging
- Next: Phase 2 (list_context tool), Phase 3 (edit_context tool)

**Impact**:
- Model can adapt verbosity based on remaining capacity
- Proactive context management (summarize when >80% full)
- No surprise "context full" errors
- Transparent token usage tracking

### SOTA Research COMPLETE ✅ → Skills System Paused

**Completed (Oct 30, 2025)**:

  - **POSTPONED**: Sandboxing (high effort, medium impact)
- 📄 **Created**: ai/research/tui-agents-sota-2025.md (64KB comprehensive analysis)
- 📐 **Designed**: docs/architecture/skills-system-design.md (Skills architecture)

**Skills System Phase 1-2 COMPLETE** (Commits: 6149bd6, 35262c5):
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure (SkillMetadata, SkillDiscovery, SkillTool, SkillManager - ~1,600 lines)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: SkillExecutor + Agent integration (~460 lines, Commit: 35262c5)
  - SkillExecutor with approval workflow (360 lines, 10 tests)
  - Integrated into SkillTool and Agent struct
  - Agent API: list_skills(), get_skill(), reload_skills()
  - Capability-based tool access control
- ✅ SKILL.md format with YAML frontmatter + progressive loading
- ✅ Three-tier discovery: project > user > system
- ✅ 32 comprehensive tests across all modules (22 Phase 1 + 10 Phase 2)
- ✅ Compiles successfully with zero errors
- ⏸️ **Phase 3-4 PAUSED**: Example skills, documentation (awaiting validation results)

**Next Priority**: Week 9 Empirical Validation (REFOCUSED)
- Validate memory systems work (3,725 lines unproven)
- Automated testing strategy (no manual testing available)
- Measure performance improvements with existing code

### Week 7-8 INTEGRATION COMPLETE ✅ → All 7 Components Fully Wired!

**Phase 2 Complete (Weeks 7-8 Integration)**:
- **Week 7 Day 1**: ✅ Event bus + LSP manager foundation (+822 lines: 343 events + 479 LSP)
- **Week 7 Day 2**: ✅ Event bus + LSP manager wired into Agent (Commit: 7efed2f)
- **Week 7 Day 3**: ✅ Mode enforcement wired into Agent (Commit: e0c9b1b)
- **Week 7 Day 5**: ✅ Git snapshots wired into Agent (Commit: cd1580e)
- **Week 7 Day 6**: ✅ Model router wired into Agent (Commit: f1d0741)
- **Week 8 Day 1-2**: ✅ Specialized agents wired into Agent (Commit: 2796e97)
- **Week 8 Day 3-4**: ✅ Research sub-agents wired into Agent (Commit: 31e8b4e)

**INTEGRATION STATUS**: 7/7 components now wired into Agent struct (100%)!

**What's Actually Wired Now** (Today: Oct 29, 2025):
1. ✅ **Event Bus**: write_file/edit_file emit FileChanged events → LSP receives them
2. ✅ **LSP Manager**: Listens to FileChanged events, ready to trigger diagnostics
3. ✅ **Mode Enforcement**: Agent checks AgentMode.allowed_tools() before tool execution
4. ✅ **Git Snapshots**: SnapshotManager.create_snapshot() called before run_command/edit_file/write_file
5. ✅ **Model Router**: ModelRouter initialized in Agent, ready for select_model() calls
6. ✅ **Specialized Agents**: AgentRegistry initialized with 7 configs (Explorer, Builder, Debugger, Refactorer, 3 sub-agents)
7. ✅ **Research Sub-Agents**: ResearchSubAgentManager initialized, ready for spawn_research() calls

**What Works Now**:
- Tools emit events when files change (actual event flow working)
- Tools blocked if not allowed in current mode (safety working)
- Git snapshots created before risky operations (rollback capability working)
- All infrastructure available for full end-to-end execution

**Execution Flow COMPLETE** (Oct 29, 2025 - Commit: 49a4bd4):
- ✅ UserIntent → Select specialized agent config
- ✅ Assess task complexity → Route to appropriate model
- ✅ (If Explorer + Research) → Spawn parallel sub-agents
- ✅ Use specialized system prompts
- ✅ Execute with cost-optimized model selection

**Week 9 Validation Progress** (Oct 30, 2025):
- ✅ **Priorities 0-2 COMPLETE**: Model routing fixed, integration tests created
- ✅ **Test Validation COMPLETE**: 258/279 tests passing (92.5% pass rate)
  - 17/17 Week 7-8 integration tests ✅ (hybrid architecture validated)
  - 21 edge case failures (minor, non-critical)
  - See: ai/TEST_RESULTS_2025-10-30.md
- ✅ **Compilation Errors Fixed**: 3 type errors resolved
- ✅ **Docker Investigation COMPLETE**: Fixed 61GB build issue
  - Created .dockerignore (excludes 57GB target/ directory)
  - Project size breakdown documented
- ⚠️ **Benchmark Blockers Identified**:
  - Terminal-Bench npm package doesn't exist yet (404 error)
  - Rust version mismatch (Dockerfile uses 1.70, need 1.79+ for Cargo.lock v4)
  - Alternative: Manual validation tasks or SWE-bench
- 🎯 **Next**: Context awareness improvement (user insight) OR manual validation
- 📊 **Gap Identified**: End-to-end benefits unproven (60% reduction, 90% speedup)

**What's New (Week 7-8 Achievements)**:
- Event-driven LSP integration with global diagnostics map
- Real-time feedback loop: edit → LSP → diagnostics → agent
- Plan mode (read-only) vs Build mode (modification capable)
- Tool restriction system based on agent mode
- Git snapshots for safe experimentation + 100% rollback
- Thread-safe snapshot manager with event bus integration
- Cost-aware model routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus based on complexity)
- Usage tracking with 40% cost reduction target

### Week 6 COMPLETE ✅ → Architecture Redesigned Based on SOTA Research!

**Phase 1 Complete (Weeks 1-6)**:
- **Week 5**: ALL 3 memory systems operational (3,725 lines)
- **Week 6 Days 1-4**: ACP protocol enhanced (+635 lines production, +470 lines tests)
- **Week 6 Day 5**: SOTA research (Factory Droid, OpenCode, Claude Code, Amp)
- **Week 6 Day 6**: New system design created (ai/SYSTEM_DESIGN_2025.md, +500 lines)
- **Competitive parity**: 30-33% (infrastructure solid)

**Major Strategic Pivot**:
- Hybrid architecture combining best patterns from 4 leading agents
- Plan/Build separation (OpenCode), specialized agents (Factory Droid)
- Smart sub-agents (research only), LSP integration, Git snapshots
- Multi-model routing (Amp), memory systems (our innovation)
- **WEEK 3 COMPLETE**: Episodic memory system (+815 lines)
  - 5 DuckDB tables tracking everything
  - 11 CRUD operations, auto-recording in pipeline
  - 7 query methods for intelligence
- **WEEK 4 COMPLETE**: Knowledge graph system (+1,470 lines)
  - petgraph-based graph structure (5 node types, 6 edge types)
  - Tree-sitter extraction for Rust (expandable to 19+ languages)
  - Binary persistence with bincode (save/load validated)
  - 8 query methods (get_file_structure, find_callers, get_dependencies, etc.)
  - Incremental updates (remove_file, update_file)
  - Fully integrated with IntelligenceEngine
  - Comprehensive test suite (7 tests covering all functionality)
- **WEEK 5 COMPLETE**: Working memory system (+820 lines) + Integration validation (+620 lines test code)
  - ContextWindow with intelligent pruning (remove bottom 30% when 80% full)
  - Relevance scoring: time decay × task association × dependencies × type weights
  - DynamicContextManager integrating all 3 memory systems
  - 9 unit/component tests + 8 comprehensive integration tests
  - Enables continuous work without restart
  - End-to-end validation: realistic multi-task workflows, pruning behavior, pattern learning
- **Frontend strategy**: Toad terminal UI (Python/Textual) via ACP
- **Agent backend**: Rust (keep 86K lines investment)
- **POC status**: Memory system validated (60% improvement) - Rust port COMPLETE!

### What Works
**Core Infrastructure**:
- Semantic Search: 6,468 vectors, 19+ languages, <2ms search latency
- Multi-Provider Auth: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama
- Tree-sitter parsing: 19+ languages for syntax highlighting
- Tool framework: End-to-end execution without crashes

**ACP Protocol** (Week 6 Day 1 discovery - already 90% complete!):
- JSON-RPC over stdio transport ✅
- Agent trait implementation (6 methods) ✅
- initialize(), new_session(), prompt() all working ✅
- --acp flag in main.rs ✅
- Proper logging to stderr ✅
- Works with Zed editor (ready to test)

**6 Real Tools** (production-ready, 2,300+ lines total):
1. analyze_errors (378 lines): Pattern matching, actionable suggestions
2. read_file (430 lines): Syntax highlighting, AST context extraction
3. write_file (450 lines): Atomic writes, backups, protected files
4. edit_file (530 lines): Dual modes (search/replace + line-based)
5. list_files (700 lines): Recursive traversal, filtering, metadata
6. **analyze_code (190+ lines NEW!)**: AST analysis, complexity metrics, quality scores, suggestions

### What Doesn't Work Yet
- **3-4/10 tools still stubs** (down from 5!): Some reflection/planning tools still returning stubs
- **ACP Protocol**: Not implemented (Week 3-4 target)
- **Intelligence wiring**: Code exists but not fully in execution path
  - DuckDBMemory built but not connected
  - Episodic memory not recording
  - Pattern learning not active
  - SearchCodeTool has intelligence support but needs wiring in registry
- **Code understanding tools**: ✅ DONE! (analyze_code, search_code, find_definition, find_references)

### Known Issues
**LM-Centric Interface Problems** (Research-identified):
1. ❌ read_file returns entire files (should window to 100 lines max)
2. ❌ No linting/validation in edit_file (should auto-reject syntax errors)
3. ❌ No result limits in search (should max 50 results)
4. ❌ No context management (should keep last 5 interactions)

**Model Routing Issues** (Identified Oct 29, RESOLVED Oct 29-30 ✅):
**Phase 1 Complete** (Commits: 9423e55, d411998, 507bcc4):
1. ✅ **Outdated model names**: FIXED - Updated to claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-haiku-4-5
2. ✅ **Too much Opus usage**: FIXED - All agents now use Sonnet 4.5 for medium/high, Opus removed from routing
3. ✅ **Single-model default**: FIXED - Added config.model_routing.single_model support
4. ⏸️ **Provider flexibility**: PARTIAL - Config supports provider field, but Agent only implements Anthropic (TODO: OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter)
5. ✅ **OAuth subscriptions**: IMPLEMENTED (Oct 30, 2025) ✨
   - ✅ OAuth token loading from ~/.local/share/aircher/auth.json
   - ✅ Token refresh logic using Anthropic OAuth endpoint
   - ✅ Auto-refresh on expiration
   - ✅ Fallback to API key if no OAuth tokens
   - ✅ Tokens copied from OpenCode (Max subscription)
   - ✅ ClaudeApiProvider now checks OAuth first
   - **Status**: READY FOR TESTING
**Status**: OAuth complete, ready for SWE-bench validation. Phase 2 enhancements in ai/MODEL_CONFIG_PLAN.md

**Episodic Memory System (Week 3 ✅ IMPLEMENTED)**:
- **DuckDB schema**: 5 tables operational (tool_executions, file_interactions, task_history, context_snapshots, learned_patterns)
- **11 CRUD operations**: Full create/read/update for all tables
- **Auto-recording**: Hooked into tool execution pipeline
- **7 query methods**: File history, co-edit patterns, success analytics, etc.
- **Pattern learning**: Co-edit detection working (files changed together)
- **Total code**: +815 lines (schema + CRUD + recording + queries)
- **Status**: PRODUCTION READY, tracking all agent activity

**Knowledge Graph + Working Memory (Week 4-5 planned)**:
- **Architecture designed**: petgraph + tree-sitter + dynamic pruning
- **POC validated**: 60% improvement with full system
- **See**: ai/research/memory-system-architecture.md for complete design

## What Worked

### Week 1-3 Execution (AHEAD OF SCHEDULE)
- **Week 1**: File tools (2,110+ lines, 21+ tests) ✅
- **Week 2**: Code understanding tools (analyze_code, +5 tests) ✅
- **Week 3**: Episodic memory system (+815 lines) ✅
- **Planning accuracy**: 10-week roadmap structure working perfectly
- **Quality focus**: Production-ready code, comprehensive tests, zero warnings

### Architecture Decisions
- **Rust backend**: 86K lines invested, correct choice (performance critical for benchmarks)
- **Toad frontend**: Universal terminal UI (saves 4-6 weeks vs custom TUI)
- **ACP-first**: Works in 5+ frontends (Toad, Zed, Neovim, Emacs, JetBrains)
- **Enhanced prompting** over complex orchestration (1685-line savings)
- **Memory systems**: Three-layer architecture (POC validated 60% improvement)
  - **Episodic memory**: DuckDB ✅ DONE (tracks everything, learns patterns)
  - **Knowledge graph**: petgraph in-memory (microsecond traversals) - Week 4
  - **Working memory**: Dynamic context with intelligent pruning - Week 5

## What Didn't Work

### Over-Engineering
- Built MultiTurnReasoningEngine (1685 lines) - research showed models do this internally
- Solution: Removed, replaced with enhanced prompting (300 lines)

### Missing Research Application
- Research shows LM-centric interfaces matter 3-5x
- We built tools without windowing, limits, validation
- Need to retrofit Week 1 tools with research patterns

## Active Work

**Current (2025-11-03)**: vLLM GPU Acceleration ✅ SUCCESS

**Completed (Nov 3, 2025)**:
- ✅ **vLLM Server Running on Fedora**: GPU-accelerated inference operational
  - Model: openai/gpt-oss-20b (13GB in 24GB RTX 4090 VRAM)
  - Performance: 2-3s latency (vs 7-10s with Ollama on M3 Max) - ~3-4x speedup
  - Configuration: GPU utilization 0.7, dtype auto, no quantization
  - KV cache: 18,736 tokens (0.86 GiB), CUDA graphs captured (4s, 0.84 GiB)
  - Endpoints validated: `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions` working
- ✅ **Aircher OpenAI Provider Fix**: Added "openai" to CLI check_api_key() (Commit: f217e77)
- ✅ **Binary Rebuild**: 67M binary with OpenAI support (Nov 3 16:54)
- ✅ **Documentation**: FEDORA_SETUP.md updated with working configuration (Commit: 561c9c2)
- ⏳ **Integration Test**: Blocked - need to restart vLLM with --api-key flag when Fedora online

**Key Learnings**:
1. Model path: HuggingFace format `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (not Ollama `gpt-oss:20b`)
2. GPU utilization 0.7 reliable (0.8 caused CUDA OOM during graph capture)
3. vLLM validates API keys - must use `--api-key` flag to set expected key
4. Config location: `~/.aircher/config.toml` (NOT `~/.config/aircher/config.toml`)
5. User helped by stopping GDM to free GPU resources (good troubleshooting)

**Previous (2025-10-30)**: Week 9 Empirical Validation - REFOCUSED

**Completed (Oct 30, 2025)**:
- ✅ **SOTA Research**: 8 agents analyzed, 40+ feature matrix (ai/research/tui-agents-sota-2025.md)
- ✅ **Skills Phase 1**: Core infrastructure complete (1,600 lines, 22 tests, Commit: 6149bd6)
- ⏸️ **Skills Phase 2-4**: PAUSED - resuming after validation proves memory systems work

**Reality Check**:
- 3,725 lines of memory code (Episodic + Knowledge Graph + Working Memory)
- 7/7 hybrid architecture components integrated
- 17/17 integration tests passing
- **BUT**: No empirical proof memory systems provide 60% improvement
- **BUT**: No benchmarks vs Claude Code
- **BUT**: Manual testing not available

**Refocused Priority**: Automated validation of existing code
- Prove memory systems work (or don't)
- Measure actual performance improvements
- Validate hybrid architecture benefits
- Use automated testing only
- ✅ **Priority 1**: Integration validation
  - Comprehensive code review of all 7 components
  - Verified event emission, mode checks, model selection, agent selection
  - Created detailed validation report: docs/integration_validation_2025-10-29.md
  - Found one minor gap (Git snapshots in main loop) - not blocking
- ✅ **Priority 2**: Unit/Integration testing
  - Created comprehensive test suite: tests/week7_8_integration_test.rs (19 tests)
  - Tests cover: event bus, mode enforcement, model router, agent selection
  - Library compiles successfully
  - ⚠️ **Blocked**: Cannot run tests due to pre-existing errors in test binaries
  - Commit: c2ed83f

**Test Coverage Created** (19 tests):
- Event bus: emission, subscription, multiple subscribers
- Mode enforcement: Plan blocks writes, Build allows all
- Model router: routing logic, single override, cost estimation
- Agent selection: specialized prompts, subagent spawning
- File operations, context windows, custom routing

**Blocking Issue**:
Pre-existing compilation errors in test binaries (test_multi_turn_reasoning.rs, test_intelligent_debugging.rs, test_real_functionality.rs) prevent running our new Week 7-8 integration tests. Library itself compiles successfully.

**Progress**: Priority 0-2 complete (model routing fixed, validation done, tests created). Ready for Priority 3 once test binaries are fixed.

**What's Been Integrated** (Oct 29, 2025):
1. ✅ Event bus: Tools emit FileChanged after write/edit (3 execution paths)
2. ✅ LSP manager: Already listening, will auto-trigger on FileChanged
3. ✅ Mode enforcement: execute_single_tool checks allowed_tools()

**What Still Needs Integration**:
4. ❌ Git snapshots: Call create_snapshot() before bash commands, bulk edits
5. ❌ Model router: Add to Agent struct, use for provider selection
6. ❌ Specialized agents: Agent must select config based on UserIntent
7. ❌ Research sub-agents: Explorer agent must spawn ResearchSubAgentManager

**Estimated Time Remaining**: 5-7 hours for items 4-7

**Week 7-8 Summary** (Code Written, Not Integrated):

**Day 1: Event Bus + LSP Manager** (Commit: 6fa8d17)

**Event Bus System** (src/agent/events.rs - 343 lines):
- ✅ tokio::sync::broadcast-based event bus
- ✅ Event types: FileChanged, DiagnosticsReceived, TestResults, ToolExecuted, ModeChanged, SnapshotCreated, SnapshotRolledBack
- ✅ EventListener with filtering and timeout support
- ✅ 6 comprehensive tests (all passing)

**LSP Manager** (src/agent/lsp_manager.rs - 479 lines):
- ✅ Global diagnostics map: HashMap<PathBuf, Vec<Diagnostic>>
- ✅ Event bus integration for real-time diagnostics
- ✅ Language server lifecycle management (rust-analyzer, pyright, gopls, typescript-language-server)
- ✅ JSON-RPC communication over stdio

**Next Steps**: ACTUAL INTEGRATION (Week 7-8 Wiring)

**Immediate Priority - Wire Week 7-8 Components**:

1. **Event Bus + File Operations** (Critical)
   - ⚠️ Status: Event bus exists, tools don't emit events
   - 🔧 Fix: Modify file_ops.rs tools to publish FileChanged events
   - 📍 Files: src/agent/tools/file_ops.rs, src/agent/tools/approved_file_ops.rs

2. **LSP Manager Integration** (Critical)
   - ⚠️ Status: LSP manager exists, not triggered by file changes
   - 🔧 Fix: LSP manager already listening, just need tools to emit events
   - 📍 Files: Already done in lsp_manager.rs, depends on #1

3. **Mode Enforcement** (High Priority)
   - ⚠️ Status: AgentMode tracked, not enforced
   - 🔧 Fix: Tool registry must check mode before allowing execution
   - 📍 Files: src/agent/tools/mod.rs (ToolRegistry)

4. **Git Snapshots** (Medium Priority)
   - ⚠️ Status: SnapshotManager exists, never called
   - 🔧 Fix: Call create_snapshot() before bash commands, bulk edits
   - 📍 Files: src/agent/tools/build_tools.rs (run_command)

5. **Model Router** (Medium Priority)
   - ⚠️ Status: Module exists, not in Agent struct
   - 🔧 Fix: Add ModelRouter to Agent, use for provider selection
   - 📍 Files: src/agent/core.rs, provider selection logic

6. **Specialized Agents** (Low Priority - Can Wait)
   - ⚠️ Status: Configs exist, agent doesn't use them
   - 🔧 Fix: Agent must select config based on UserIntent
   - 📍 Files: src/agent/core.rs initialization

7. **Research Sub-Agents** (Low Priority - Can Wait)
   - ⚠️ Status: Manager exists, never spawned
   - 🔧 Fix: Explorer agent must spawn for research queries
   - 📍 Files: src/agent/core.rs execution path

**Realistic Timeline**:
- Priority 1-2 (Event bus + LSP): 1-2 hours
- Priority 3-4 (Mode + Snapshots): 2-3 hours
- Priority 5 (Model router): 1-2 hours
- Priority 6-7 (Specialized + Sub-agents): 3-4 hours
**Total**: 7-11 hours of actual integration work

**After Integration - Then Week 9**:
- Validate integrated features actually work
- Terminal-Bench evaluation (if basics work)
- Honest competitive assessment

**Week 10: Research Paper + Release**
- Paper: "Hybrid Agent Architecture: Combining Best Patterns"
- Open source release, community launch

## Metrics

### Competitive Position
- Claude Code parity: 30-33% (✅ ACHIEVED Week 2 target!)
- Tools: 6/10 real (analyze_errors + 4 file ops + analyze_code)
  - Code understanding: 4/4 real (search, analyze, find_def, find_refs)
  - File operations: 4/4 real (read, write, edit, list)
- Tests: 26+ passing (+5 new for analyze_code)
- Build: Compiles with pre-existing errors in unrelated modules

### Code Stats
- Rust files: 214
- Total lines: 86,781
- Real tool lines: 2,110 (production-quality)
- Test coverage: Comprehensive for implemented tools

### Infrastructure vs Capabilities
- ✅ Strong foundation (semantic search, multi-provider, parsing)
- ⚠️ Intelligence built but not connected (2,000+ lines unused)
- ❌ Need to wire memory, fix interfaces, add code tools
