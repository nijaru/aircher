# TODO - Current Tasks & Priorities

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-10

## âœ… COMPLETED: Agent-First Architecture Refactor

### What Was Achieved
**Problem Solved**: Eliminated duplicate agent implementations (TUI AgentController vs ACP Agent)  
**Solution Implemented**: Single UnifiedAgent with TUI using LocalClient frontend  
**Impact Delivered**: Full consistency, reduced maintenance, true ACP compliance

**Status**: ðŸŽ¯ **PRODUCTION READY**

## âœ… COMPLETED: Intelligence-First Architecture Activation

### ðŸŽ¯ INTELLIGENCE ACTIVATION SUCCESS
**Achievement**: Sophisticated intelligence infrastructure now fully operational!

### Intelligence Activation Results âœ…
- âœ… **IntelligenceEngine Connected** to UnifiedAgent (echo responses replaced)
- âœ… **Intelligence Testing Framework** created and validated  
- âœ… **Context-Aware Prompt Enhancement** implemented with rich analysis
- âœ… **Autonomous Learning Features** integrated (memory, patterns, insights)
- âœ… **Project-Aware Response Generation** fully functional with confidence scoring

### Current Architecture Components âœ…
- âœ… **UnifiedAgent**: Single source of truth for agent behavior
- âœ… **LocalClient**: Direct TUI access for optimal performance  
- âœ… **AgentIntegration**: Clean TUI bridge replacing AgentController
- âœ… **Streaming Pipeline**: Full tool execution with real-time updates
- âœ… **ACP Compatibility**: Agent trait implemented and ready
- âœ… **IntelligenceEngine**: Advanced contextual AI system (**ACTIVE & OPERATIONAL**)
- âœ… **Project Memory**: Learning system with pattern recognition (**INTEGRATED**)
- âœ… **Development Narrative**: Momentum and direction tracking (**FUNCTIONAL**)

## ðŸš€ NEXT SPRINT: Editor Integration & Tool Enhancement

### ACP Protocol Integration (Phase 1)
- [ ] Implement ACP server for editor communication
- [ ] Create RemoteClient for JSON-RPC protocol  
- [ ] Test with Zed, VS Code, and other ACP-compatible editors
- [ ] Document editor setup and configuration

### Tool System Enhancement (Phase 2)
- [ ] Multi-file operations (batch editing, refactoring)
- [ ] Advanced git integration (status, diff, commit, branch)
- [ ] Workspace awareness (project detection, build systems)
- [ ] Test execution and coverage reporting

### Intelligence Refinement (Ongoing)
- [ ] Performance optimization for intelligence analysis
- [ ] Enhanced learning from user interactions  
- [ ] Cross-project pattern recognition improvements
- [ ] Memory persistence and cleanup

## ðŸŽ¯ Architecture Success: Complete Intelligence-First System

Both major architectural achievements are **complete and production-ready**:

### Agent-First Architecture âœ…
âœ… **Single Source of Truth**: UnifiedAgent eliminates duplication  
âœ… **Performance Maintained**: TUI uses direct LocalClient calls  
âœ… **Standards Compliance**: ACP trait ready for editor integration  
âœ… **Streaming Functional**: Full pipeline with real-time tool updates  
âœ… **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing TUI functionality preserved  

### Intelligence-First Experience âœ…  
âœ… **Autonomous Intelligence**: Sophisticated contextual AI system active
âœ… **Project Awareness**: Memory, patterns, and narrative tracking functional
âœ… **Enhanced Responses**: Rich intelligence analysis with confidence scoring  
âœ… **Learning System**: User preferences and successful patterns remembered
âœ… **Context Integration**: Relevant files, actions, and insights provided

**Result**: Aircher now delivers **true autonomous intelligence** with **revolutionary user experience**.
