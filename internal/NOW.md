# NOW - Current Sprint & Priorities

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27
**Current Focus**: Phase 1 - Core Agent Intelligence (Week 1)

## 🎯 Strategic Direction

**Agent-First Philosophy**: Building the best autonomous agent with complete transparency - skipping enterprise features

See `AGENT_FIRST_ROADMAP.md` for complete 18-week plan.

## 🚀 Current Sprint: Real Tool Implementation (Week 1-2)

### This Week's Focus: Replace Stubs with Real Tools

**Problem**: 9 out of 10 strategy tools are stubs returning fake JSON - no user value
**Solution**: Implement real, production-quality tools that provide actual functionality

### Week 1 Tasks (File Operations)

#### 1. Real `read_file` Tool
- [ ] Syntax highlighting integration (tree-sitter)
- [ ] Context extraction (surrounding code)
- [ ] Smart truncation for large files
- [ ] Error handling and permissions

#### 2. Real `write_file` Tool
- [ ] Automatic backup before write
- [ ] Directory creation if needed
- [ ] Protected file detection (no overwriting lib.rs, main.rs, etc.)
- [ ] Atomic writes with rollback

#### 3. Real `edit_file` Tool
- [ ] Precise line-based editing
- [ ] Context-aware changes
- [ ] Change validation
- [ ] Diff preview before applying

#### 4. Real `list_files` Tool
- [ ] Intelligent filtering (gitignore respect)
- [ ] File metadata (size, modified, type)
- [ ] Directory tree visualization
- [ ] Smart sorting

**Success Criteria**: Can complete basic file manipulation tasks with real user value

### Week 2 Tasks (Code Understanding)

#### 1. Real `search_code` Tool
- [ ] Leverage existing semantic search (production-ready)
- [ ] Intelligent query expansion
- [ ] Context extraction around matches
- [ ] Relevance ranking

#### 2. Real `analyze_code` Tool
- [ ] AST-based code analysis
- [ ] Complexity metrics
- [ ] Pattern detection
- [ ] Quality suggestions

#### 3. Real `find_references` Tool
- [ ] Cross-file reference finding
- [ ] Symbol usage tracking
- [ ] Import/export analysis
- [ ] Relationship mapping

#### 4. Real `get_definition` Tool
- [ ] Symbol definition lookup
- [ ] Context inclusion
- [ ] Multiple definition handling
- [ ] Type information

**Success Criteria**: Agent can understand and navigate codebases effectively

## 📊 Current Status (Reality Check)

### What Works ✅
- **Semantic Search**: Production-ready (6,468 vectors, 19+ languages)
- **TUI Interface**: Complete terminal UI
- **Multi-Provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama
- **Tool Framework**: Executes without crashing
- **Dynamic Context Architecture**: Implemented (ahead of competitors)

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **9/10 tools are stubs** - return fake JSON, no real value
- **No autonomous capabilities** - can't solve real problems
- **Limited agent intelligence** - tools exist but don't function
- **16-20% competitive parity** - massive gap to close

### Recent Competitive Intelligence
- **Amp Analysis**: Sourcegraph Amp analyzed our old subagent plans, unaware we pivoted to Dynamic Context
- **Browser Agents**: Jules, Replit, Copilot Workspace emerging as full automation platforms
- **Our Advantage**: Dynamic Context > Sub-agents/Threads (19% performance gain proven)
- **Market Gap**: Professional developers want autonomy + transparency + local execution

## 🎯 Success Metrics (This Sprint)

### Week 1 Success
- [ ] 4 real file operation tools working
- [ ] Can successfully read/write/edit/list files
- [ ] No crashes or data loss
- [ ] User testing confirms value

### Week 2 Success
- [ ] 4 real code understanding tools working
- [ ] Can navigate and analyze codebases
- [ ] Semantic search integrated
- [ ] 8/10 tools now real (vs 1/10 currently)

### Phase 1 Success (6 weeks)
- [ ] All 10 strategy tools are real
- [ ] Multi-step task execution working
- [ ] Project-aware intelligence functional
- [ ] 40-50% competitive parity achieved

## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing

### Enterprise Features (Explicitly Out of Scope)
- ❌ Team collaboration
- ❌ Enterprise SSO
- ❌ Multi-user workflows
- ❌ Audit trails
- ❌ Cloud deployment

### Focus: Best Agent, Not Enterprise Platform
- ✅ Autonomous capabilities
- ✅ Transparent reasoning
- ✅ Local-first architecture
- ✅ Individual developer productivity

## 📋 Immediate Next Actions (This Week)

1. **Start with `read_file`** (Day 1-2)
   - Integrate syntax highlighting
   - Add context extraction
   - Test with various file types

2. **Implement `write_file`** (Day 2-3)
   - Safety checks and backups
   - Protected file detection
   - Atomic write operations

3. **Build `edit_file`** (Day 3-4)
   - Line-based editing logic
   - Context-aware changes
   - Preview and validation

4. **Complete `list_files`** (Day 4-5)
   - Gitignore respect
   - Smart filtering
   - Useful metadata

5. **Testing & Integration** (Day 5-7)
   - End-to-end testing
   - User acceptance testing
   - Bug fixes and polish

## 🔄 Documentation Updates

### This Week
- [ ] Update `PROJECT_REALITY.md` with new tool implementations
- [ ] Add tool implementation patterns to `KNOWLEDGE.md`
- [ ] Document decisions in `DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] Keep `NOW.md` current (daily updates)

### When Tools Complete
- [ ] Update competitive parity estimate in `PROJECT_REALITY.md`
- [ ] Document lessons learned in `DISCOVERIES.md`
- [ ] Update `STATUS.md` with actual working features

## 🎯 Phase 1 Roadmap Preview

**Week 1-2**: Real Tool Implementation (CURRENT)
**Week 3-4**: Autonomous Execution (task planning, tool selection)
**Week 5-6**: Project Intelligence (pattern learning, context-aware actions)

**End Goal**: Agent that autonomously completes multi-step tasks with full transparency
