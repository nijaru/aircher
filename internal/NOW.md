# TODO - Current Tasks & Priorities

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-10

## âœ… COMPLETED: Agent-First Architecture Refactor

### What Was Achieved
**Problem Solved**: Eliminated duplicate agent implementations (TUI AgentController vs ACP Agent)  
**Solution Implemented**: Single UnifiedAgent with TUI using LocalClient frontend  
**Impact Delivered**: Full consistency, reduced maintenance, true ACP compliance

**Status**: ðŸŽ¯ **PRODUCTION READY**

## ðŸš€ STRATEGIC PIVOT: Intelligence-First Approach

### ðŸŽ¯ NEW PRIORITY: Activate Autonomous Intelligence
**Discovery**: We have sophisticated intelligence infrastructure that's completely unused!

### Immediate (This Week) - Intelligence Activation  
- [ ] Connect IntelligenceEngine to UnifiedAgent (replace echo responses)
- [ ] Create intelligence testing framework  
- [ ] Implement context-aware prompt enhancement
- [ ] Test autonomous learning and memory features
- [ ] Validate project-aware response generation

### Current Architecture Components âœ…
- âœ… **UnifiedAgent**: Single source of truth for agent behavior
- âœ… **LocalClient**: Direct TUI access for optimal performance  
- âœ… **AgentIntegration**: Clean TUI bridge replacing AgentController
- âœ… **Streaming Pipeline**: Full tool execution with real-time updates
- âœ… **ACP Compatibility**: Agent trait implemented and ready
- âœ… **IntelligenceEngine**: Advanced contextual AI system (DORMANT - needs activation)
- âœ… **Project Memory**: Learning system with pattern recognition
- âœ… **Development Narrative**: Momentum and direction tracking

## ðŸ“‹ Intelligence Activation (Current Sprint)

### Core Intelligence Integration
- [ ] Replace echo responses with intelligence-enhanced responses
- [ ] Integrate contextual analysis into prompt processing
- [ ] Enable project memory learning from interactions
- [ ] Implement development narrative tracking

### Intelligence Testing Framework
- [ ] Create intelligence validation test suite
- [ ] Test context awareness and relevance scoring
- [ ] Validate memory learning and pattern recognition  
- [ ] Test cross-session intelligence persistence

### Secondary Features (After Intelligence)
- [ ] Editor integration (ACP protocol)
- [ ] Enhanced tool UX improvements
- [ ] Advanced tool support (multi-file, git)

## ðŸŽ¯ Architecture Success

The agent-first refactor is **complete and production-ready**:

âœ… **Single Source of Truth**: UnifiedAgent eliminates duplication  
âœ… **Performance Maintained**: TUI uses direct LocalClient calls  
âœ… **Standards Compliance**: ACP trait ready for editor integration  
âœ… **Streaming Functional**: Full pipeline with real-time tool updates  
âœ… **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing TUI functionality preserved  

**Next Focus**: Enable editor integration and enhance production features.
