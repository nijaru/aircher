# Aircher Development Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-13

## 🎉 Current State: Fully Functional AI Agent

Aircher is now a **fully functional AI coding agent** with working tool calling, semantic search, and multi-provider support.

### ✅ Major Achievements

#### 🚨 CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: Tool Calling Fixed (2025-09-11)
- **Tool calling now works**: Fixed fundamental bug where `tools: None` was sent to LLMs
- **Ollama provider fixed**: Added missing tools field to OllamaRequest struct
- **Agent integration complete**: Connected AgentController to TUI successfully
- **Multi-turn execution**: Agent can execute tools, get results, and provide answers
- **Verified working**: Integration tests pass, gpt-oss model confirmed functional
- **6 tools available**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_files, search_code, run_command

#### Recent Fixes (2025-08-26)
- TUI input reliability: Enter submits; Shift/Ctrl+Enter newline; Tab accept suggestion
- Non-blocking sends: streaming updates no longer freeze the UI
- Operations line: streaming status now appears above input (not in status bar)
- Predictive compaction: proactive compaction at ~85% context or warning
- Ollama defaults: default provider/model set to `ollama / gpt-oss`
- Ollama fallback: auto-switch to available local model if selected is missing
- Tool status lines: compact, one-line messages with durations; batch header for multi-tool runs

#### Performance Milestones
- **99.9% faster subsequent searches**: 0.02s (from cache) vs 20s (rebuilding)
- **80% faster indexing**: 15-20s for typical projects (was 2+ minutes)
- **Complete index persistence**: Cached searches eliminate rebuild overhead
- **Zero CPU spikes**: Batch processing and cooperative multitasking
- **Production scale**: 105 files, 3,066 chunks, 100% embedding coverage

#### Technical Excellence
