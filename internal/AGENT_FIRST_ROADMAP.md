# Agent-First Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27
**Philosophy**: Build the best autonomous agent with complete transparency and control - skip enterprise features

## üéØ Strategic Focus: Agent Capabilities Over Enterprise Features

Based on comprehensive competitive analysis (see `KNOWLEDGE.md`), we have clear advantages:

### Our Unique Position
1. **Agent-Level Autonomy** - Match Jules/Replit/Claude Code autonomous capabilities
2. **Complete Transparency** - Show every decision and action (unlike Claude Code's "flying blind")
3. **Dynamic Context Management** - Superior to competitors' Sub-agents/Threads architecture (19% performance advantage)
4. **Unlimited Local Execution** - Ollama integration = no rate limits, consistent performance
5. **Hybrid Control Model** - Can run fully autonomous OR step-by-step (user choice)

### What We're NOT Building (Enterprise Creep)
- ‚ùå Team collaboration features
- ‚ùå Enterprise SSO/compliance
- ‚ùå Multi-user workflows
- ‚ùå Audit trails and governance
- ‚ùå Cloud-based execution

### What We ARE Building (Best Agent)
- ‚úÖ Autonomous multi-step task execution
- ‚úÖ Transparent agent reasoning and decision-making
- ‚úÖ Project-aware intelligence (learns patterns, remembers context)
- ‚úÖ Adaptive execution strategies
- ‚úÖ Local-first architecture with privacy

## üìä Current Reality (Honest Assessment)

### What Actually Works ‚úÖ
- **Semantic Search**: Production-ready, 19+ languages, sub-second performance
- **TUI Interface**: Complete terminal UI with model selection
- **Multi-Provider Auth**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama
- **Basic Tool Framework**: Executes without crashing
- **Dynamic Context Management**: Architecture implemented (ahead of competitors)

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
- **9/10 strategy tools are stubs** returning fake JSON

- **Limited agent intelligence** - can't actually solve problems yet
- **Missing core tools** - file operations, git, testing, debugging

### Current Competitive Position
- **16-20% feature parity** with Claude Code
- **Strong foundation** but minimal user value
- **Architectural advantage** not yet realized in functionality
