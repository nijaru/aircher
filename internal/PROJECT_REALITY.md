# üö® Project Reality: Honest Assessment

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27
**Purpose**: Brutally honest assessment of actual vs claimed functionality
**Repository**: Public at https://github.com/nijaru/aircher

## üìä Current Competitive Position

**Reality**: ~17-21% feature parity with Claude Code (up from 16-20%)

### What Actually Works ‚úÖ
- **Semantic Search**: Production-ready, 19+ languages, sub-second performance
- **Multi-Provider Auth**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama authentication
- **Real read_file Tool**: Production-quality with syntax highlighting, AST context extraction ‚ú® NEW
  - 430+ lines of actual implementation (not stubs)
  - Tree-sitter syntax highlighting for 19+ languages
  - AST-based context extraction (surrounding functions/classes)
  - Smart truncation for large files
  - File metadata (size, permissions, modified time)
- **Real analyze_errors Tool**: Pattern matching, actionable suggestions (378 lines)
- **Basic Tool Framework**: Framework exists and executes without crashing

### What's In Progress (Week 1) üîÑ
- **write_file Tool**: Next implementation (Days 2-3)
- **edit_file Tool**: Following (Days 3-4)
- **list_files Tool**: Final Week 1 tool (Days 4-5)

### What's Still Broken/Missing ‚ùå
- **8 out of 10 tools are stubs** returning hardcoded JSON (down from 9)
- **ACP Protocol**: Not implemented (Week 3)
- **No TUI**: Removed - focusing on ACP agent backend only
- **Missing core features**: Multi-file operations, code understanding tools

## üéØ The Real Problem We're Solving

**Before**: 9/10 tools were stubs returning fake JSON - no actual value
**Now**: 2/10 tools are real, implementing Week 1-2 of 10-week plan
**Target (Week 10)**: 8+ real tools + ACP protocol + empirical validation vs Claude Code

**Current Strategy**: 10-week research project targeting publication with empirical benchmarks

## üîç What We Actually Built

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Achievements
- **10 stub tools** prevent runtime crashes
- **MockProvider** enables deterministic testing
- **Strategy execution framework** functions end-to-end
- **Test infrastructure** ready for real tool development
- **Public repository** at https://github.com/nijaru/aircher

### ‚úÖ Real Tools Implemented (2 total)

#### 1. RealAnalyzeErrorsTool (Sep 19, 2025)
- **378 lines** of actual error analysis
- **Pattern matching** for Rust errors (borrow checker, type mismatches, imports)
- **Location extraction** from error messages (file:line:column)
- **Actionable suggestions** based on error patterns
- **Confidence scoring** (90% for pattern matches)

#### 2. EnhancedReadFileTool (Oct 27, 2025) ‚ú® NEW
- **430+ lines** of production-quality implementation
- **Syntax highlighting**: Tree-sitter for 19+ languages (rust, python, js, go, etc.)
- **Context extraction**: AST-based analysis of surrounding functions/classes
- **Smart truncation**: Configurable max_lines with first/last portions
- **File metadata**: Size, permissions, modified time, language detection
- **Comprehensive tests**: File reading, line ranges, error handling

**Stub Output**: `{"path": "file.txt", "content": "fake content"}`

**Real Tool Output**:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "path": "/path/to/file.rs",
    "size_bytes": 4523,
    "modified": "2025-10-27 14:30:00",
    "permissions": "644",
    "language": "rust",
    "total_lines": 120,
    "displayed_lines": [1, 120]
  },
  "content": "   1 ‚îÇ use std::path::Path;\n   2 ‚îÇ ...",
  "truncated": false,
  "context": [
    {
      "context_type": "function",
      "name": "read_file",
      "start_line": 5,
      "end_line": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö® Honest Competitive Analysis

## üîß What Still Needs to Be Built (10-Week Plan)

### Week 1 (Current - File Operations)

- Polish and reliability competitive

## üí° Key Insights

### What This Work Accomplished
- **Stable foundation** for building real tools
- **First production tool** (read_file) with full feature set
- **Test infrastructure** allows iterative improvement
- **Proof of concept** that real tools can be built
- **Public repository** ready for collaboration

### What This Work Didn't Accomplish Yet
- **Limited user value** (only 2/10 tools real)
- **No ACP integration** (still Week 3 target)
- **No competitive testing** (benchmarks Week 7-8)

### Strategic Direction
1. **10-week research project** targeting publication
2. **Focus on quality** - production tools, not stubs
3. **Empirical validation** - benchmark vs Claude Code
4. **ACP-first** - work in Zed/JetBrains, not building TUI
