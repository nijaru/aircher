    "instruction": "I've put an image at /app/image.ppm that I rendered programmatically. Write a c program image.c that I can run and compile and will generate an image that's as close as possible to the image I put here.\nSpecifically, I will compute the normalized L2 similarity in [0,1] and yours must match with 0.99 similarity.\nYour image.c file should not read image.ppm.\nYour output should be to a new file reconstructed.ppm in the cwd.\nI will test it by calling gcc -static -o image image.c -lm && ./image and expect that the reconstructed file will be basically identical.\nYour c program must be <2k when compressed (`cat image.c | gzip | wc`) to ensure the solution is algorithmic rather than embedding data. It also may not put extra code in other .c or .h files to #include, but it can #include normal system files.",
