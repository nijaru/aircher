You are an expert systems engineer. You will be given a task to complete in a Linux terminal environment.

Your job is to provide the exact shell commands needed to complete the task. Return your response as a JSON object with:
- "commands": a list of shell commands to run (in order)
- "explanation": a brief explanation of what the commands do

Task: Convert the file '/app/data.csv' into a Parquet file named '/app/data.parquet'. The CSV file contains sample data with headers.

Think step by step:
1. What needs to be done?
2. What commands are needed?
3. In what order should they run?

Return only valid JSON in the format:
{
  "commands": ["command1", "command2", ...],
  "explanation": "brief explanation"
}
