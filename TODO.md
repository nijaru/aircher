- [ ] Support commit creation
- [ ] Add branch operations
- [ ] Integrate git log viewing

### Workspace Awareness
- [ ] Detect project type (Rust/Python/JS/etc)
- [ ] Load project-specific configurations
- [ ] Understand build systems
- [ ] Parse dependency files
- [ ] Track open files context

### Test Execution
- [ ] Run tests with proper environment
- [ ] Parse test output formats
- [ ] Show test failure details
- [ ] Support different test frameworks
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

## üîß Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Fix remaining compiler warnings (20 warnings as of 2025-08-25)
- [ ] Add tests for tool calling integration
- [ ] Document agent system architecture
- [ ] Clean up unused imports and dead code
- [ ] Refactor large functions in TuiManager

### Documentation
- [ ] Update TECH_SPEC.md with agent architecture
- [ ] Document tool calling flow
- [ ] Add provider integration guide

### Performance
- [ ] Profile tool execution bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize message parsing
- [ ] Reduce memory usage in agent controller
- [ ] Cache provider responses where appropriate
- [ ] Batch tool operations when possible

## üí° Future Ideas

### Turbo Mode v2 (Phase 6)
- [ ] Implement task orchestrator
- [ ] Add two-tier model configuration (high/low)
- [ ] Support parallel task execution
- [ ] Add task dependency resolution
- [ ] See `docs/architecture/turbo-mode.md`

### Intelligence Features
- [ ] Code understanding with AST analysis
- [ ] Smart refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Automatic bug detection
- [ ] Performance optimization hints
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning

### Session Management
- [ ] Save/restore conversation sessions
- [ ] Branch conversation history
- [ ] Export sessions to markdown
- [ ] Share sessions between users
- [ ] Session templates for common tasks

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed (2025-08-25)

- [x] Fix Ollama provider tool support (was hardcoded to false)
- [x] Verify agent system IS connected to TUI
- [x] Document actual vs assumed functionality
- [x] Test tool calling with gpt-oss model
- [x] Update documentation to reflect reality
- [x] Parse OpenAI-style JSON tool calls
- [x] Fix OllamaMessage struct fields

## üìù Notes

- Agent system more functional than documentation claimed
- Main issues are provider-specific bugs and polish
- Tool calling works but needs UX improvements
- Focus on reliability before adding new features
